EPISODE: S1E01
======================================================================

The episode begins with Elliot saying "Hello friend", to his imaginary friend, the audience. He tells them that what he is about to say is top secret, a conspiracy about the top 1%. He thinks that they are following him. He sees two men dressed in black talking and looking at him. He thinks that they are following him because of what he did the previous night. He thinks that he should have gone to Angela 's birthday party.
A flashback shows him at Ron's Coffee Shop . Elliot approaches the owner, Rohit "Ron" Mehta , who has just entered the shop. Elliot informs Ron that after observing the traffic on Ron's network, Elliot decided to hack him. Elliot discovered that Ron had been running a child pornography website, and had been using Tor to keep the servers anonymous. Ron seems shocked, and is noticeably shaken by the confrontation. Ron thinks that Elliot is trying to blackmail him and refuses to give any money, thinking that Elliot would keep asking for more and eventually tell the police anyway. After Elliot tells him that he has anonymously tipped off the police about Ron, Ron attempts to pay him off, but Elliot refuses by telling him that he doesn't care about money.
At the subway a man asks him what's happening, which Elliot ignores. The man then says "Exciting time in the world right now. Exciting time".
Elliot enters the Allsafe Cybersecurity offices, where he works as a cybersecurity engineer. Before he can reach his desk, Gideon Goddard calls him into his office, where Elliot meets with Angela. One of their clients, E-Corp , has been attacked again, and they are sending a group to hear exactly what happened during the attack.
After leaving the office, Angela confronts Elliot about him not going to her birthday party, saying that he promised he would try to. A flashback shows Elliot at the door of the location of her birthday party, but then Angela brings him back, saying "Stop thinking about something else when I'm talking to you". Eventually the conversation deescalates when Ollie appears, and Elliot leaves them.
At his therapist's office , Elliot tells his imaginary friend on how easy it is to hack Krista. He discovers that she is divorced, looking for a partner online, and is currently dating Michael Hensen , who Elliot finds little about. She asks him "What is it about society that disappoints you so much?" and Elliot explains, though only in his head, his anti-capitalism views and how he thinks that social media, celebrities and movies are mostly a method of sedation. After sitting quiet for a while, Elliot tells her not to be frustrated, because she at least understands what it's like to feel alone, that she wants to protect people from it and that's what he respects about her. When Krista asks him why he thinks she understands (since he discovered it by hacking her), he says that he doesn't know how.
Back at Allsafe, Ollie asks Elliot if he wants to have lunch with him. Elliot tells him that he already has plans. Ollie tries to tell Elliot that he feels things have been awkward between them, and that he wants them to get along. Elliot simultaneously tells his imaginary friend about Ollie: amongst his Facebook likes, Elliot finds George W Bush's Decision Points , Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen and the music of Josh Groban. Elliot thinks that that's enough not to like Ollie, but then adds that after hacking Ollie he found that Ollie had cheated on Angela multiple times with Stella B . Elliot says that he thought about telling Angela about this but he is not ready to see what "comes after". Back in their conversation, Ollie says that he likes Elliot and wants him to like him too. Elliot responds that he will try harder.
Elliot thinks that he shouldn't really hate Ollie, because he is not that bad, he is, rather, too dumb to be bad. Elliot says that when he thinks about the really bad people. That's when people from E-Corp arrive, he thinks about "Evil Corp". This is how Elliot has "reprogrammed" his mind to hear, see or read their name when they appear.
After E-Corp staff pass by him, Elliot thinks that Terry Colby , E-Corp's CTO (Chief Technology Officer) is a moron, an arrogant moron and unqualified for his job, using a Blackberry as his phone. Here Tyrell Wellick meets Elliot. He notices Elliot's use of Gnome , a desktop environment for Linux. Tyrell says that personally he uses another, KDE , what might seem unusual since he is an executive, but as he says "old habits, they die hard". He leaves Elliot after saying that "it's gonna be fun working with you".
After work, at Elliot's apartment, we learn that he's depressed and uses morphine to handle his life. He says that he keeps his usage lower than 30 mg (milligrams) per day while taking suboxone , a drug for patients on withdrawal or used for treating opiate addiction. He notices his stock of the latter has ended and calls his next-door neighbor Shayla for more. She offers it for free but he refuses. She asks if he wants to do molly (ecstasy) with him and the next scene shows them naked in bed, Shayla sleeping and he smoking. He gets an alert from Krista's Instagram that she is in Pierre Loti with Michael.
He finds Michael's address by using social engineering on the taxi company, saying that he forgot his keys in a car. While he watches Michael and Krista from afar, he sees the men in black watching him from a table across the street. When Michael leaves, the man from the subway comes to the table where the men in black are sitting and asks for any spare change. When Elliot eventually meets with Michael, he asks him for his phone to "call his mother ", when he actually calls himself to get Michael's number. Then, Elliot quickly deletes his number from Michael's call log.
He gets a call from Angela asking him to go to Allsafe because of what appeared to be just a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack against E-Corp. Elliot arrives there and finds out, that the servers are infected with a malicious software that can do practically anything on the servers by that point. Elliot says, that the only way to fix it would be to shut down the servers, clean the infection, and turn them back up.
Gideon and Elliot fly to the Dulles server farm to clean the infection. Elliot starts to examine the infected server and then identifies a file labeled fsociety00.dat, along with a text file (readme.txt) reading "LEAVE ME HERE" referring to the malware, the dat file, or both. Elliot says to himself that he's going to shut them down anyway, but then, he hesitates, he asks himself "What's wrong with me", and enters "N" to cancel the deletion. He stopped the hack by reconfiguring the access to the "root directory" (main, head folder), so only he can use it. Elliot is sure that "No one will know".
After leaving the server farm, at the plane, Gideon reveals to Elliot that he is gay, saying that even though he doesn't like to talk about his sex life, his partner wants him to be more open about it. Gideon seems stressed about the hacks so Elliot tells him not to worry, and explains, that hackers have short attention spans and will eventually harass someone else. Gideon feels that his company would have to go out of business if E-Corp left them. Elliot promises that he will find the hackers.
At the subway, the mysterious man from before sits in front of Elliot. His jacket has a marking with "Mr. Robot" written on it. He says that Elliot should come with him, but only if he didn't delete "it", referring to the hack. On the station, the man tells Elliot about his father who was a thief, got arrested, and died five years later. He thought that his father was free by stealing but actually he was in a "prison", just like Elliot is now, he says. The man is confident he will break Elliot out. They go to Coney Island where "Mr. Robot" shows him the other hackers on his team but does not disclose the plan.
Elliot goes home by himself and meets Angela at his door. She invites him to get high and watch Elliot's favorite movie Back to the Future II . When they went inside, they found Shayla still sleeping naked in his bed. Angela leaves irritated and Elliot tells Shayla to leave as well. Elliot tries to find information about fsociety and Mr. Robot but finds very little. He then puts all of the found data in a white envelope as evidence for Gideon and E-Corp. Elliot goes to Coney Island and talks with Mr. Robot again. He tells Elliot that their plan is to destroy E-Corp's databases so that they can erase most of the world's consumer debt. Mr. Robot tells him to put Terry Colby's IP address on the .dat file to make him appear responsible for the hacks. At home Elliot researches the effects of debts and decides to create another envelope, a blue one, which then he puts in a backpack with the white one.
At Allsafe, Elliot meets with Angela, Gideon, the executives from E-Corp and agents from the FBI . He places the white envelope at the table. After Colby treats Angela rudely, Elliot changes the white envelope for the blue one, in which Tyrell notices and gives it to the FBI, saying that with that they can find whomever is guilty of the hacks. 19 days pass and there is still no news from the FBI. The team from fsociety are not in the Coney arcade anymore. He decides to continue his attempt of hacking Michael Hansen but again it results in nothing. He realizes that this isn't his real name. In the next scene Elliot confronts Michael saying that he learned that he cheated on his wife with 7 different women and that he has proof of this. He demands that Michael breaks up with Krista and tell her the truth, otherwise he will tell everything his wife and the police, for one of the women was 15 (though Elliot explains to his "friend" that this last part was a lie). Michael agrees and Elliot asks also for his dog to help him with his loneliness.
In his next meeting with Krista he can see that she has been crying and that this must be because Michael told her the truth and broke up with her. Elliot meets with Angela and while they are talking, there is a newsbreak about Terry Colby's arrest for his supposed involvement with the hacks. While Elliot cheers outside, some men dressed in black tell him to get into their car and take him to a conference room. There he sees Tyrell Wellick, who is accompanied by other business man. They look like the one percent of the top one percent, what scares Elliot. Tyrell greets him with " Bonsoir, Elliot " (good evening, Elliot).
Elliot asks his imaginary friend "Please tell me you're seeing this too".

EPISODE: S1E02
======================================================================

Elliot watches as a group of men in suits sit at a round table with Tyrell Wellick at the head. "Give a man a gun and he can rob a bank. Give a man a bank and he can rob the world", Tyrell says. He explains that he likes this saying because it means that power resides with those who take it. He tells Elliot this meeting may be illegal, so he has gathered 11 lawyers, and offers Elliot to be the head of Cybersecurity for E-Corp . Elliot asks to think about it.
Tyrell dismisses the lawyers. Alone, he tells Elliot that he is on his way to becoming CTO and would like to thank the hackers who took down his predecessor, Terry Colby . He informs him that E-Corp will be internalizing their network by the end of quarter, so Allsafe will be cut loose and go out of business, thus Elliot should be with him. Elliot declines.
Elliot is driven home by Mr. Sutherland , who gives him a number to reach Tyrell. Walking to his apartment, Elliot comes across his neighbor/drug dealer Shayla bickering with Fernando Vera . As he drives away, Shayla tells Elliot that he was just an employer that can't take a hint. Elliot asks for a refill, but Shayla is hesitant because she doesn't have withdrawal meds to go with it. Elliot insists anyway.
At home, Elliot snorts some of his morphine, then goes to work hacking Tyrell. He finds that Tyrell's password to E-Corp's mail system is trivial, and starts to look through the mail and then comments to the viewer that this was too easy, its as if Tyrell expected Elliot to hack him. Panicked, Elliot pulls the memory chips, disk drives, and other components from his system and destroys them (microwaving chips, drilling holes in disk drives). He puts all of the ruined bits into a trash bag and goes out and tosses it into a subway station trash bin.
Elliot arrives at Allsafe, where he wonders if everyone is looking at him, but their attention is on the office TV which is showing news of the arrest of Terry Colby. Elliot wonders to the viewers whether he destroyed Colby's life just to advance Tyrell.
Gideon calls Elliot in and gives him a raise, a recognition for saving the company, but Gideon is curious about the dat file, and why Elliot didn't talk about it at the meeting. Elliot tells the viewer he's worried about how much Gideon is suspecting, but says that he wasn't yet really sure if the dat file was anything else, it could have been junk. Gideon however is satisfied, but wants Elliot to keep investigating, since the fsociety hackers could do anything. Elliot is alarmed: how does Gideon even know the name "F Society"? Gideon shows him a video that the group just released.
In the video, a figure in a mask and with a filter-distorted voice represents "F Society". It addresses "Evil Corporation", and says they "we" have been watching, "we" know how evil E-Corp is and all that it has done to oppress humanity, and "we" have collected tons of data stolen from E-Corp's systems, dirt that would bring down E-Corp if released. And they will release it, unless their demands are met: the release of their leader Terry Colby, the freeing of all of the debts of the world's debtors, and the dismantling of E-Corp. "The people of the world no longer accept your economic slavery".
Outside on a busy sidewalk, Angela and Ollie run into Elliot. (Nearby, there's a guy handing out his music CD's, free, he only wants people to like him on social media.) They congratulate Elliot on saving the company, and invite him to dinner. Elliot pauses, uncertain, and then notices in the crowd two men in black coats, looking like E-Corp security men, moving towards him. He quickly accepts their offer and hurries off home. (Angela and Ollie pass by the CD guy and Ollie accepts a CD from him.)
Elliot gets home, and he's telling the viewer that he's worried about the fsociety hackers and the data dumps they have from E-Corp, what they were talking about with freeing Colby, none of that was anything he had heard fsociety was doing. He needs to cut his ties with them. But in his apartment he discovers one of the fsociety hackers, Darlene , using his shower to take a bath, as if she had every right to be there. She borrows some of his clothes, saying hers are in a washer, and says Elliot had been expected to come last night, the others are expecting him later today. She seems strangely familiar with him, but he pretends that he doesn't know her at all.
Elliot and Darlene take the subway to Coney Island. He asks her how it is she knows him, but she assumes they know each other, it's only natural she knows where he lives and all that. Elliot remarks to the viewers that she's just weird, or crazy, if this is fsociety, maybe he should go to Gideon and tell him everything. She switches him to another train just ahead of the two E-Corp security men following them, he tells the viewers that it's as if she can see them too, they're not a hallucination.
They get to the fsociety hangout on Coney Island, and the other hackers, Mr. Robot , Leslie Romero , Mobley , and Trenton , applaud him, and say he did a good job. But Darlene asks Mr. Robot about the " Steel Mountain plan", and he says it's not ready. They all go do different things, and Mr. Robot and Elliot talk.
Mr. Robot says they have a plan: E-Corp, and many other evil corporations, maintain backups at Steel Mountain, that's a secure place, what we can do is, Elliot can use his Allsafe clearance to hack the Comet natural gas plant near Steel Mountain, we're working on what to do there to cause a natural gas explosion that will destroy the Steel Mountain facility. Elliot is aghast at this, and asks if the other hackers know this plan, and Mr. Robot says Elliot is the first.
This is way outside Elliot's comfort zone, he says he's not killing anyone. As Elliot goes to leave, Mr. Robot asks, "are you a one or a zero? Are you a yes or a no? Are you going to act or not?" Elliot refuses: "Life's not that binary." But Mr. Robot continues: "Beneath every choice, there's either a one or a zero." Elliot leaves, though Mr. Robot says, if he leaves, he's gone from the group, don't come back.
During a subway trip home, Elliot wonders to the viewers whether he should turn fsociety in.
He arrives home and checks in at Shayla's, and only discovers Fernando Vera there, dressed only in underwear, and he says Shayla is in the tub, and doesn't disturb her. They talk, Elliot uncomfortably, about Elliot's drug use, while Elliot explains to the viewer on what he's found about Vera: he's the "worst human being he's ever hacked", running drugs, porn, and guns, and his e-business is terribly unsecured, so the evidence of all that, including killing rivals, is all available. It would be easy to turn Vera in, but he's Shayla's only supplier, so Elliot needs him. Vera gets dressed and leaves, leaving behind the hint, backed up by his gun: Shayla is his.
Once Vera is gone, Elliot breaks into the bathroom, and finds Shayla bruised and drugged out in the tub. She says Vera came over, they smoked some, and that's all she remembers; it's clear she's been drugged and raped. But she doesn't want Elliot to do anything about Vera, she needs his money.
Elliot walks the streets, musing to the viewer on how Mr. Robot is right, we have to pick yes or no. He could do nothing, keep getting his drugs from Vera and Shayla; but Vera kills people, and has just raped Shayla, Elliot says he has no choice.
Elliot is at an appointment at Krista 's office, and he's complaining about "everything", about not being in control, not having choices worth making. (Throughout, this scene is interspersed with scenes of him doing web search into Vera's crimes with drugs and guns.) We think we can make choices, but they're trivial, like which of two drinks we want, but none of it really matters. (Elliot is shown uploading a file to an NYPD Anonymous Tip Line website.) It's as if the choices we make are predestined. (Now we see Elliot walking along a street, and there are Vera and several others, handcuffed and surrounded by police, as other police load evidence into a van.) Elliot tells Krista he had been in a "project", which he thought could have been special, but it turned out to be a mistake, might as well have done nothing. Krista says that Elliot had earlier talked about how his father had similarly chosen to do nothing about his cancer, or the company that gave it to him, and that he had no options, but Elliot now has options. Elliot gets upset and won't talk about his father, or anything else.
At home, Elliot is burning his Vera files onto a CD, and labeling it as music. His phone rings, it's Angela, he ignores it.
At home, Angela hangs up the phone, and tells Ollie she's worried about Elliot, he's been seeming out of sorts at work. Ollie is busy at his laptop, he's been trying to insert the CD he was given earlier, but he complains that it just freezes his computer. He checks his email, and there's mail from Stella B , with a picture and a message "come over tonight". Ollie takes care that Angela not see this, and tells her that he needs to go out and meet with a buddy who is unexpectedly in town. He leaves, but his laptop is still on, with its camera facing the bathroom where Angela is.
And now we see the CD guy, sitting in a library, looking at his laptop screen, which is showing what Ollie's laptop sees. Angela moves out of the camera view, so the guy closes the window. He opens another window that seems to be a chat in Chinese characters. He adds a line to the chat, in Chinese, but a subtitle translates it: "(Cisco) we're in".
The next day, Elliot is out walking on the boardwalk along the ocean, and finds Mr. Robot sitting on the railing. Elliot sits with him, looking over the rock-strewn beach. Elliot says he's come up with a plan to destroy the Steel Mountain backups without using an explosion. Mr. Robot doesn't want to hear about it until he gets past an issue. Elliot walked away, and now wants back in. He needs to hear from Elliot about his father. With some reluctance, Elliot explains that his father was his best friend, he worked at E-Corp all his life until they suddenly fired him, then he developed leukemia. He made Elliot swear not to tell anyone, not even Mom , even though he got sicker and sicker. Eventually he got so bad that Elliot told his Mom, and that got Dad so angry that he pushed Elliot out of the window, and Dad never spoke to Elliot after that, to the day he died.
Elliot asks Mr. Robot, so, are we good now? Mr. Robot nods and puts his hand on Elliot's shoulder. He says he knows what it's like to lose a parent, but did Elliot ever think he deserved what Dad did to him? Elliot says no, he didn't do anything, he was trying to help. Mr. Robot pushes Elliot off the railing, unto the rocks below. Mr. Robot comments to the air, "You didn't commit to the sacred pact you'd formed", and walks away.

======================================================================
EPISODE: S1E03
======================================================================

Tyrell Wellick is preparing a speech as he goes about starting his day, he is exercising, dressing, but throughout he is mentally rehearsing and refining a speech to give to the E-Corp CEO. The company is doing well, but there are challenges ahead, and we need a good CTO, and I should be that CTO. He practices in front of a mirror, over and over: "You will be the next CTO of this company".
Tyrell is sitting in the CEO's waiting room, mentally repeating over and over, "You will be the next CTO of this company". Finally, the CEO, Phillip Price , comes out of his room, but before Tyrell can start his speech, Price says effectively "you'll need to reschedule your appointment, there's a CTO candidate that the board is very excited about, we'll keep you informed, maybe I'll see you in a few weeks". Price hurries off, leaving Tyrell with his promotion speech unsaid.
Tyrell looks dejected as two E-Corp security men drive him through town. They stop at a street corner, where there's a homeless man waiting for them. Tyrell meets the man and pays him $300, takes off his coat and tie, puts on rubber gloves and proceeds to beat the man bloody, the man just taking the hits without any attempt to defend himself. Tyrell's guards just wait by the car until he is done. They drive him home, leaving the homeless man writhing on the ground.
Elliot wakes up in a hospital bed. He muses to the viewer on how debugging is not about fixing a mistake, it's about finding the bug and understanding why it was there to begin with, the bug exists to give the viewer a message. Elliot is bandaged and bruised, but wakes enough to recognize Shayla and Krista . He tells them that he was jumped by a bunch of kids. Krista wants to keep him in the hospital for a drug test, and suggests rehab, but Elliot says he's not an addict. Krista says she'll release him if he passes a drug test. Elliot remarks to the viewers that this is no problem, he uses this hospital because it has pitiful network security, he can easily change any of his medical records or test results.
Out of the hospital, Elliot and Shayla stop at a convenience store, where Elliot immediately snorts some morphine. They find that the credit card system at the store is down, due to the fsociety hack on E-Corp. Elliot remarks just to the viewer that he, Elliot, was the bug that fsociety found and is taking advantage of.
Shayla asks if Elliot had anything to do with Vera getting busted, Vera was Shayla's income, but Elliot denies any involvement. At home, he finds Darlene there, wanting to talk, but Elliot just tells her to get out. To Shayla's surprise, Elliot gets himself ready to go back to work that day, to the viewers he says, a bug is never just a mistake, it represents something bigger.
Out on the street, Angela is jogging, and a man runs past by her, dropping a wallet. She picks up the wallet and runs after him, shouting "Sir! Sir! You dropped your wallet!" He comes back and accepts the wallet from her, and runs off. Just as a young woman comes up saying he stole her purse, that was her wallet that Angela gave back to him.
Ollie is at home, looking at his laptop, and an email, "We own you and you will do what we want", the mail includes pictures of Stella B and an mail from her. Ollie is on the phone to Stella, saying "he wants me to put the CD on one of the computers at work". But Angela comes home, and Ollie hangs up the phone. Angela talks about running and the wallet, and Ollie smiles, this shows how good a person she is. She goes for a shower, and the phone rings for Ollie, a voice saying "You have one hundred hours, after that we'll release everything".
The scene switches to Cisco on the phone. After he hangs up, he goes to his laptop chat window, and adds another line in Chinese: "He'll break soon". Cisco continues to watch Ollie through the laptop camera, as Ollie paces around the apartment.
In Gideon 's office at Allsafe , he is giving directions to Elliot, Ollie, Angela, and Lloyd , on things to monitor to track down fsociety, in hope that fsociety makes a mistake. Elliot remarks to the viewer that the world we live in has us relying on other people's mistakes, to manipulate us. Gideon goes on to invite the team to his place for dinner tonight, and all accept except for Elliot. Gideon sends everyone else out and tries to talk with Elliot, his injured appearance and irregular attendance cause concern, but Elliot doesn't want to reveal any of his personal life.
Elliot tells the viewers that Mr. Robot may have found the bug at Evil Corp, but hasn't found Elliot's bug, it's the way he protects himself, closing himself off where nobody can find him. He gets to his desk, and there's Mr. Robot, waiting for him. Elliot doesn't want to talk to him, but Mr. Robot gives him the choice of having a scene here at the office, or having a drink at the bar next door.
Mr. Robot has a drink, but Elliot says he wants nothing to do with him. Mr. Robot says he's sorry for what he did to Elliot, and he never wanted to hurt him, he's sure Elliot's dad also wanted to apologize for what he did to Elliot, so Elliot shouldn't stay mad at him for too long. Mr. Robot gets up to leave, and Elliot is surprised on what about the plan? Mr. Robot explains, Elliot is the key, without him there is no plan, so it's over. He walks out.
Elliot is elated as he explains to the viewers that, with fsociety done away with, he's free from the "recent glitch in the otherwise neat reality" that he had created over the years. He'll strive to be more like a normal person, maybe have Shayla as a girlfriend, see Marvel movies with her, join the gym, like things on Instagram , drink coffee from Starbucks . "I'm gonna lead a bug-free life from now on, anything to protect my perfect maze."
Elliot returns to Gideon's office, carrying a Starbucks latte, and asks. Can I come to the dinner? And bring his girlfriend? Gideon says sure, but he's astonished, as if Elliot acting "normal" is unusual.
At Ollie's desk at Allsafe, he's almost ready to put the CD into his system, and sees Angela coming over. He pulls the disk out, they get their bags and leave.
Tyrell is at home, and is using his phone to investigate the Kiss and Fly Club, which looks like a gay hangout, and finds the club's page for Anwar Raziz , Philip Price's secretary. His wife Joanna , heavily pregnant, comes in. Tyrell says he's going out, to the Kiss and Fly Club. She's concerned, but he says it's for work, and necessary. She's still not sure, but he leaves anyway.
Elliot visits Shayla and invites her to the dinner party, and this actually gets her upset, first Vera used her and now Elliot is going to use her to look better in a social situation. She complains that he scarcely knows her (he remarks to the viewer that he knows her very well, he hacked her email long ago and knows all about her). Then she goes and starts showing her the artwork she's been working on, fabric and wall-art, all of it expressive in a way Elliot never knew. Elliot realizes he never actually knew her, she has her own maze, her own way of being at the fringe of society, like Elliot but in a different way. He explains to the viewer, that "when a bug finally makes itself known, it can be exhilarating, like you just unlocked something".
Outside the Kiss and Fly Club, Anwar and his friends exit, talking, when Anwar notices Tyrell waiting outside. Tyrell starts the conversation, as if he doesn't even know Anwar's name, but quickly gets to his being there, it's just to meet Anwar, because he's beautiful, and grabs him for a kiss. (Elliot tells the viewer. Because, after all, a bug's only purpose, its only reason for existence, is to be a mistake that needs fixing, to help you right a wrong, and what feels better than that?)
Elliot, Shayla, and the other workers arrive at Gideon's apartment, and stand around awkwardly until they are admitted. Gideon takes Elliot aside for a private chat, he says he had checked with Dulles again, and again there was nothing, he wants to make sure Elliot understands how valued he is. He even hugs Elliot (an awkward thing for Elliot), to reinforce in Elliot how he shouldn't doubt his skills and keep going, no matter the pressure Gideon puts on him.
After dinner, there is small talk going on around the living room. Angela and Elliot are sharing stories of their childhood together, with Angela, Elliot isn't awkward at all. But then the phone rings, and they turn on the TV to discover reporting of a new data dump of emails from inside E-Corp, revealing that the company knew everything about the 1993 toxic waste leak in Washington Township (that killed Elliot's father and Angela's mother ). The company, and Terry Colby in particular, were aware of the leaks, and decided not to spend money reducing them as it would not be cost-effective. Elliot tells the viewers: "My perfect maze crumbling before my eyes; there's nothing to hide behind". It's clear that fsociety orchestrated this leak to get Elliot back with them. "Mr. Robot finally found my bug". Elliot walks out of the apartment, quickly followed by a tearful Angela.
In a flashback, we see eight-year-old Elliot, and his mother Magda , both sitting at a bus stop. Elliot is sad about the death of his father, but his mother is nothing but dismissive of him, "he did this to himself, he gave in. He was a coward". When Elliot says he misses his father, his mother says there's no reason to, it just means Elliot is weak like his father. A bus comes by and stops. The voice of Elliot tells the viewer, "The bug forces the software to adapt, evolve into something new because of it. Work around it or work through it. No matter what, it changes. It becomes something new. The next version. The inevitable upgrade". The bus drives off, and now we see the same bus stop, but sitting there is only adult Elliot.
Tyrell and Anwar finish a violent session of anal sex together. Tyrell cleans Anwar some off and tells him to go take a shower. Once Anwar is in the shower, Tyrell goes and finds his pants, gets an SD card, and gets Anwar's phone. He boots the phone from the SD card and installs a superuser, connected to a web account. He puts the phone back into Anwar's pants, and goes to join him in the shower.
Ollie is pacing around his apartment, worried, when Angela arrives. Ollie is bothered that Angela will talk about things with Elliot but not with him. Angela says she will, but not right now. After some thought, Ollie says he has a problem, and shows her his laptop. She examines the blackmail message, and the pictures and screenshots attached to it, it details not only Ollie's relationship with Stella, but also information the hacker gleaned about Angela's bank accounts, and from that Angela's father 's bank accounts. For a while Angela says they need to break up, this threatens her father's finances, and she can't handle that. But she pulls back from that, and the figure they have to come up with something to do about this, but they don't know what.
Gideon is in his office, looking yet again at the report from the data center about the fsociety dat file, and the IP address highlighted on it, Terry Colby's IP address. He glances at a news report on his laptop, titled "Did Colby implicate himself?" It's 9:40 PM, it's late, but he picks up the phone and calls Dulles, and says he wants to talk to Sean Skyler about server CS30 again.
Tyrell gets home and finds Joanna in bed, with a mask over her eyes, they talk, and she's asking for some bondage sex tonight, even after Tyrell's night with Anwar. She is clearly in control of the situation, telling him what she wants tied up, and in what way. Her concern seems to be Tyrell's progress towards becoming the new CTO, and the obstacle of the potential new CTO, Scott Knowles . She says they should have dinner with Scott and his wife Sharon . Tyrell is concerned that that would be "too obvious", but Joanna says this no time to "play coy". Tyrell finishes binding and gagging her.
Elliot walks into the fsociety hideout. All of the other members are there, and silently watch to see what he does. He walks over to a table, gets out his laptop, and opens it up. The others gather around, like students watching a master prepare, they look expectant and ready to assist him. Elliot says, "Here's the plan".

Elliot is at home, musing on one last line of morphine in front of him. "The last line. The consequences of busting Vera and meeting Mr. Robot , creating you, everything till now, this moment. I chose this. I chose all this".
Elliot is with the fsociety hackers in their hideout, explaining the plan against Steel Mountain : Insert a Raspberry Pi into their network, programmed to make a back door that they can access from outside, and use that entry to raise the temperature above 95 degrees: that much heat will destroy the tapes. Romero objects that they need to get physically into the facility, but Elliot says the existing guards are the security flaw they can exploit. Elliot starts to have withdrawal symptoms, though, and goes home, leaving the others to work out details.
Back at his apartment, looking at the line of morphine, Elliot reflects for a while on how he broke his own rule on taking morphine, though he has no suboxone to counteract it. But he has things to do, and needs this one last line. He snorts the line.
Outside, Elliot is walking on the sidewalk. He notices a man in a suit walking towards him, looks back, and sees another behind him. As one of the men passes him, Elliot asks what the man wants, but he ignores Elliot, and the two men meet and talk. Elliot walks away. But once at home, he is unnerved by a pounding at his door, every pound makes him worry about E-Corp security men, but it's Darlene , the rest of fsociety want to discuss the plan.
Back at the fsociety lair, Romero says the plan is toast, E-Corp is packaging up copies of their tapes and preparing to ship them to four other facilities. If one goes down, the others will get even more secure. Elliot looks at the research Romero has done, and says that the copying and moving won't take place until April 1st, so they have a few days to get the attack done. Although Romero is skeptical, everyone else chimes in with a piece of the job that needs to be done in advance. Mobley can plan the thermostat attack on the drive there, Trenton can put together the network attack software, and Darlene will get the Dark Army to do their part. But it's Elliot who will go into Steel Mountain to plant the hardware, and Romero says Elliot's already showing bad withdrawal symptoms, he won't be good for anything in a day or so. Elliot says he has to do it, so he will.
Romero and Mobley steal a car from the street. While they are gone, Elliot asks Mr. Robot if he has any input, but Mr. Robot says it's Elliot's plan, he's the key to everything they're doing here.
Romero, Mobley, Elliot, and Mr. Robot are driving in the car, out in the country. Elliot is sweating, looking sick, as he muses to the viewer about daemons, they work in the background while our attention is elsewhere. They're always there, always active, and we can try to do something else, but our conscious desires don't drive us, our daemons do, and Elliot says he has more than most. Then he doubles over and vomits.
They get to a motel and get Elliot into bed, he says he only needs to rest a minute, but Romero says he's going downhill fast, expect fever, convulsions, leaking everywhere. Elliot, just to the viewers, adds paranoia, depression, hypersensitivity, and he should expect two weeks of that. He thinks Romero may have a point. But he keeps telling himself, he's about to change the world.
At her apartment, Angela sneaks the trojan CD out of Ollie 's bag, and his ID badge, and tells Ollie she's going to meet her dad for brunch. But instead she goes to Elliot's apartment, and finds only Shayla next door, she doesn't know where Elliot is, but invites Angela to come and walk the dog with her.
Elliot is sweating and rolling around in bed. Romero and Mobley are nearby, watching TV, as Romero complains about Elliot being incapable of doing his part, and needing plenty of nursing back to health, but Mobley says they have till tomorrow.
At the fsociety lair, Trenton uploads the Raspberry Pi network attack software to an FTP server, while Darlene complains that her Dark Army contact hasn't responded. Then she realizes, it's Sunday, she knows where her contact will be. They go out together.
Shayla and Angela are walking the dog, and Shayla offers some pills, she calls them "clarity", it'll help Angela "see past whatever's bringing you down". After a tiny bit of resistance, Angela takes one, and Shayla another.
Darlene and Trenton are at a noisy club, music and ping-pong tables, it looks like it's mostly Asians there. Darlene talks to a few people here and there, and gets nothing but shaking heads. Darlene is sure her contact will show up, but Trenton isn't convinced. Several of the locals are looking across the room towards Darlene and talking.
Elliot is still just twitching in bed, and now Mobley is upset, Elliot isn't any better. Romero says they should leave him at a hospital and start a new plan. Mr. Robot tries to talk them into staying, but Romero and Mobley leave. Elliot settles down enough to talk to Mr. Robot, saying that he just needs one more hit to get through this, it'll let him be able to get the job done. Mr. Robot looks at him, considering.
Elliot and Mr. Robot are getting out of a car at a house, Elliot really needs Mr. Robot's help to walk. There's a guy outside the house, and he knows what they're there for, but says only Elliot can go in. Mr. Robot pays him $30 and he helps Elliot go in.
Elliot is inside the house, a few people seem to be wandering about, rather scrungy, some coughing. One guy, looks like the dealer, is sitting in a chair, and offers to help Elliot. Elliot says he needs morphine pills, but the dealer offers something better, a syringe. Throughout this, Elliot is thinking, he promised not to take anymore, but he really needs this. The dealer's girlfriend helps Elliot get set up and injects the syringe. Elliot immediately looks relieved.
And then, in another room, there are two guys fighting and yelling, and one pulls out a gun and shoots. But the bullets hit the girlfriend, who falls to the floor, and Elliot, who also collapses. The dozen people in the room rush out, but can still see the dealer sitting calmly in his chair.
And Elliot is lying in front of the TV, which suddenly flashes and then shows another fsociety video. The filtered voice says it's time to "wake up to the reality of profiteering and enslavement we've been warning you about". The figure says fsociety is here to expose the villains in society, and helping all of society recover its "lost, damaged or stolen memory".
Elliot is now in the fsociety hideout, next to the masked figure in front of the TV camera. The figure takes off a key and hands it to Elliot, who asks what it opens. Then the figure takes off his mask, under which is another of the same masks. He hands a mask to Elliot, saying "It belongs to you now". Elliot puts on the mask, and now there are two masked men. One says, "Now, find your monster, then turn the key. But first... a word from our corporate overlords!" The screen blanks, and then shows what looks like an ad from E-Corp, showing the products and services they provide. An announcer says "If you see our logo, that means you can rest assured that you're buying the best food, clothing, shelter, transportation, hygiene, electronics, and life's necessities that money can buy."
Elliot is now walking along a row of identical houses, when he gets to a house with a mailbox labeled "The Aldersons". Then the house has vanished, and in its place a utility pole with the sign "Error 404 Not Found ". A young girl is skating along the sidewalk, she and Elliot say hello. Elliot asks what happened to the house, and the girl says, "First can you tell me? What's your monster?" She giggles, looks down, and sees a key on the ground, she picks it up and hands it to Elliot. She skates away, and Elliot walks away.
Elliot is now walking into his apartment. Tyrell Wellick is there, looking at a key, but says nothing to Elliot. On a table is the fishbowl with Elliot's beta fish, Qwerty , and they have a little conversation. Elliot asks if Qwerty needs anything, and Qwerty says, in a fishbowl, nothing ever changes, sitting on this table, he's exhausted with everything being the same. Elliot says he wants to help, and Qwerty asks to be moved to the window.
Elliot is now in a fancy restaurant, with Angela across the table from him. She's slicing into a fish. Elliot complains to her, "Angela, he's my friend", and Angela replies, "Yes, and he's delicious". We see at another table what look to be Elliot's mother , and eight-year-old Elliot, she's trying to get him to eat. Now a waiter arrives at Elliot's side, and delivers his plate, a fresh raspberry pie. Elliot takes a bite, chews, and finds something wrong, a key. Now Angela says out loud, "Yes. Yes!" and she stands up. "Yes, Elliot, I do!" Everyone else in the restaurant stands up and applauds. She gets up, hugs Elliot, and they both walk out of the restaurant, to the applause of the diners.
Elliot is now in a tux, walking into the fsociety lair, and Angela is there too. She says, she just told those people what they wanted to hear. "You're not gonna do it, are you? Change the world. Figures. You were only born a month ago. You're afraid. Afraid of your monster. Do you even know what it is?" Elliot looks blank. She holds out the key. "It doesn't fit". He takes it, says, "Why not?" Angela says, "Isn't it obvious? You're not Elliot. You're the--" and the screen goes black.
Elliot, in the darkness, hears children laughing. A bit of light comes on, Elliot is again in the fsociety hideout, in front of the TV camera, with the mask hanging from it. He picks up the mask and thinks, "Am I still alone? Is this the face of my only friend? Are you my monster?" He puts on the mask, and now, with a filtered voice, says "I am here. You are alone". He takes off the mask, and the lights all come on, game machines making noise...
Elliot jerks up in the motel bed, sweating, and sees nobody is there. He says, "They all left. I'm alone". He cries. "I'm alone". Mr. Robot walks in from another room. "No, you're not. I'm not going anywhere, kiddo. We're in this to the end".
It's night, Darlene and Trenton are walking on the sidewalk, Darlene is joking about but occasionally grim, complaining her contact didn't show. They look further down the street, and there's a black limousine parked there, a back door open, and a man in a devil mask standing at the door like a guard. He's looking straight at them. Darlene sees it and leads Trenton there. "It's him". They walk to the limo, and the guard moves aside to let them in. They enter the back seat, and the guard follows them in and closes the door.
Inside, Darlene and Trenton are seated facing the masked guard and another man in a devil mask. The guard demands their phones, and throws them out the window. One of the men calls out to the driver, and the limo starts up and drives off.
Angela and Shayla are in the ladies room of some night club, they both look a lot spacey, and there are few other women there doing drugs. Angela's phone rings, it's Ollie, she rejects the call and sees that he's called her a lot. Angela laughs, she has to be at work in four hours. Shayla is lamenting a little bit, she liked this job, but she'll do something else. Angela's surprised, changing jobs is a stress, and Shayla doesn't seem bothered. Angela says she worries a lot about jobs. Shayla comes over and kisses her. They kiss for a while, and Shayla tells Angela that she should only worry about herself.
The limo comes to a stop and Darlene and Trenton get out on the sidewalk. Darlene stomps away, Trenton following, they turn the corner and there is Cisco along with a few other guys. Darlene comes up to Cisco and complains how hard it's been to find him, she takes him aside. He wants her to cool down a bit, "A ray of sunshine in the dark void of my existence", but she's on fire, he hasn't apologized. He says, hey, he wanted to spend a life with her, and she dumped him. She says it's time to get going on the mission, the time to strike is tomorrow, it's their only shot. Cisco says they never had a shot, the Dark Army guys are a big deal, they don't care about all that "freeing the world" stuff that fsociety is all up about. Darlene pulls him close and kisses him. "You know how much this means to me. Please, just talk to them". He sort-of nods.
Back at the motel room, Romero is mixing up a drink for Elliot, his aunt's remedy for her ailments, anti-diarrheal, electrolytes, decongestant. He hands Elliot a glassful of gunk, and says seven more and Elliot will be as good as new. Elliot is looking a lot more alive. Romero asks Mr. Robot to make sure Elliot keeps drinking, and Romero goes out to get the car ready. Elliot talks to the viewer. "Hello again. Long time no... whatever it is we do. I missed you. Where did you go? Did you leave, or did I?" (We see Darlene waking up at the fsociety hideout, and she sees Trenton across the room, kneeling for morning prayer.) "Maybe it was both. Or neither. Doesn't matter. Did those hopeful moments scare me? Of course. Daemons, remember?"
At Allsafe , Angela is getting off the elevator, using Ollie's badge to get in, she looks a bit anxious. The office space is empty, it must be early. She walks to Ollie's desk, logs in to the computer, and puts the CD into the drive. Just then the elevator dings, it's the receptionist. Angela pushes the CD eject button, when that doesn't work she pries the door open and gets the CD out. The receptionist gets to her desk and starts arranging paperwork. We see Ollie's system briefly display a command window, then go dark. Angela goes down the elevator.
Elliot's voice tells the viewers, "At some point an 'action without user interaction' will come along and sweep my legs. This spinning wheel of false highs and true lows will continue. That much I know. Daemons-- they don't stop working. They're always active. They seduce. They manipulate. They own us. And even though you're with me, even though I created you, it makes no difference. We all must deal with them alone. The best we can hope for-- the only silver lining in all of this-- is that when we break through, we find a few familiar faces waiting on the other side".
We see a country road, with a mountain in the middle distance, and a car racing towards it.

EPISODE: S1E05
======================================================================

In a prison cell, Fernando Vera is pacing back and forth.
Vera meets his brother Isaac , and attorney Carol , in a prison visiting room. Carol says he is facing years in prison for murder, no chance for a plea bargain. The DA has a strong case against him, starting from an anonymous tip, with lots of good evidence which she shows him. He had all of his business on social media, even tweeted about every illegal transaction his group took part in, because Isaac had said it would save money. Vera isn't taking this very seriously, with comments like "men can't sentence me, that's a cosmic responsibility". But he agrees with Isaac, somebody is going to get hurt for this, that's how we get square with the universe. He looks at the collection of evidence, printouts and pictures, and seems to have an idea.
Back in his cell Vera continues pacing and thanking, until he stops and says out loud, "So that's you. That's who you are. I know you". And he smiles.
Mr. Robot , Elliot , Mobley , and Romero are sitting in a busy coffee shop. Mobley and Mr. Robot check some devices they are carrying, and Mr. Robot gets up and goes through the crowd, intentionally brushing against someone with a Steel Mountain employee ID badge. He walks back to their table, and they leave.
Now the four are in their car, and Mobley uses his laptop to read the data they captured from the RFID chip in the employee's badge. He makes up a new employee badge from a blank, with the real employee's data, and gives it to Romero. They drive up to the Steel Mountain entry gate, and Romero uses the card to get through the gate. They park in an out of the way area on campus.
Elliot remarks to the viewers on his skills at detecting the flaws in people, flaws that can be exploited: on how Mobley is a glutton, lacking discipline, while Romero is a know-it-all, and Mr. Robot is clinically insane. Mobley has researched a Steel Mountain employee, Bill Harper , Sales Associate, and his boss Wendy Gallagher . Elliot is hooked up with a microphone and speaker in his ear so the guys in the car can advise him. He will first go to Bill, then from him to get to Wendy, who would have access to Level 2. Mobley has researched Wendy through her social media, She is pregnant and about to give birth very soon, they can use that to get her away from Elliot. Then Elliot can hack the climate control system. Elliot says he's all ready.
Elliot (going by the name "Sam Sepiol") is in the Steel Mountain waiting room when Bill Harper approaches him, the guys in the car have to prod Elliot a bit in getting the conversation started. Elliot asks for a tour, and Bill explains he needs an appointment for a tour, it's company policy, Bill just can't do it. Elliot asks Bill to look him up, but Bill walks away. (Over the radio, Mr. Robot tries to feed Elliot some bombastic demand to make to Bill, but Elliot ignores him.) Elliot just waits, almost ready to leave, but Bill stops him from leaving, he used his tablet to look up the Wikipedia page on "Sam Sepiol" (which Mobley is feverishly typing in: Sam Sepiol, programmer and businessman, Elliot's picture, founder of frightfully valuable company; Elliot remarks to the viewer on how Wikipedia is never accurate, "Nerds like Mobley built a lot of credit over the years with his 20,000 edits".), and calls out "Mr. Sepiol? Good news!"
Angela is packing to leave, while Ollie complains that she should stay. She says she may be ruining her life, but she already ruined his. She gives him the CD and his Allsafe ID card, and says she used his computer to load the CD. She takes her bag and leaves.
In the hallways of Steel Mountain, Bill Harper is giving Elliot a tour, Bill describing how well Steel Mountain is made, Elliot just sort of tagging along. (In the car, Mr. Robot says they need to figure out a way to psychologically tear Bill down, so he gives up and calls a supervisor. Bill's social media suggests a stalled career, no friends other than his cat.) Elliot stalls in the hallway, and Bill waits for him. (Elliot has sort of a vision: down the hallway he sees his mother , and his eight-year-old self being slapped and accused by her: "I hate you, you're nothing". Elliot is inspired: project his own problems onto Bill.) Elliot says, "Think about it, if you died, would anyone care? They'd cry for a day, but let's be honest. No one would give a shit". Bill is mesmerized, as if this is striking a chord. Elliot expands on this theme for a while, totally not business talk but personal". That's who you are. That's what you are. You're nothing to anyone, to everyone, so instead of wasting my time, I need you to go call someone that matters, because, Bill, you don't". Bill is almost crying. (Elliot remarks to the viewers, that's why Bill is the perfect exploit, desperate enough for the business to break protocol and let me in.)
Bill calls in for a supervisor, and Elliot is expecting Wendy Gallagher, but it's another woman, Trudy Davis . The guys in the car go into a panic, they have no plan to deal with Trudy. Trudy asks what's going on here, and Elliot asks for Wendy, but Trudy says Wendy is off today (perhaps she already went into labor?), and anyway, Elliot is not on her list of visitors for today, so she will escort him to the front door.
In the car, quick research comes up with nothing to use. Trudy has little on the web, no social media, no pictures, the name of her husband but nothing they can use to make a story, like the one they planned to use to lure Wendy away. Then Mobley comes up with an idea. Everyone has vulnerabilities, we only have to adapt the way to access the vulnerability. He uses a tool to spoof a text message into Trudy's phone, from her husband: "I'm at the hospital. It's what we always feared". Trudy looks at the text and is visibly shaken; she supports herself against a wall, and announces "I have to go, I'm sorry, need to go to the office", and she leaves Elliot alone in the hallway.
There is an elevator. Elliot gets into it, but the Level 2 button won't work, there's a palmprint scanner, and Elliot gets out. Over the radio, Romero tells him the map says there's a manual door down the hall, he can pick its lock. Elliot hurries to the door, luckily none of the employees notice him, and the door is easily picked. But once inside the stairwell, Elliot sees the stairs don't go down, only up. Romero says that he's on the wrong side of the building, he should go out and run. Elliot comes out of the stairwell, and right in front of him is Tyrell Wellick : "I thought I saw you. What are you doing here?" Elliot looks blank.
In town, Shayla is learning her new job as a waitress in a restaurant.
Elliot stands nearby as Tyrell has an animated conversation with two other well-dressed worthies. Leaving them, Tyrell remarks that they were the financiers of Hezbollah and ISIS. (Elliot is thinking: Did he know I was here? why I'm here? He'll kill me!) And Tyrell asks, so, why are you here? Elliot fumbles a bit, says he's here for a routine data process check, all the Allsafe engineers take their turns doing it. They are walking along the halls as if they belong there and nobody is bothering them. Tyrell asks Elliot to join him for lunch.
In the car, the other guys are listening, and aghast, Elliot's been picked up by the effective IT boss of E-Corp , they're on to us, we have to get out of here. But Mr. Robot says they stay, nothing's changed.
Tyrell and Elliot have gotten to the employee cafeteria, and Tyrell is spouting on and on about the stuff he could buy Elliot, as this is happening, Mr. Robot is telling Elliot over the radio that Tyrell's vulnerability is being an arrogant prick and bring proud of it, he cares what you think of him. Elliot is so busy listening to Mr. Robot that he fails to notice that Tyrell has stopped talking and is looking at him. Elliot stares for a little, then says, "This place?" (In the car, Romero says, what, is the plan to piss him off? But Mobley smiles and points to their map: On Level 2 is the Executive Lounge.)
Elliot and Tyrell are walking through the hallways of Level 2, much more industrial-looking and less pretty than the other floors, and again everyone behaves as if they belong there. Over the radio, Mr. Robot warns Elliot that the radio signal will soon fail... and it does.
Seated in the elegant executive restaurant, Tyrell remarks to Elliot how he's impressed that Elliot is still plugging away for Allsafe, the company's finished but Elliot is still doing his best for them, Tyrell says that he and Elliot are the same, both perfectonists. He directs Elliot's attention to their waiter, he's served Tyrell at this restaurant for maybe seven years, in his 50's, kids, divorced, and his life has been at its peak for decades, $30,000 a year salary, 2-bedroom apartment, debts, child support, using coupons, "The life of an ordinary cockroach whose biggest value is to serve me salad".
Elliot looks up, and towards them are walking two uniformed security people! Elliot has thoughts of handcuffs clicking! The security people come up to Tyrell and hand him a clipboard. Tyrell signs a document, and the security people take it and go away. Elliot says he has to go to the bathroom. Tyrell looks after him, thoughtfully chewing.
Elliot gets to the restroom and vomits into a sink, thinking whether this is withdrawal, or maybe about Tyrell and what game they are playing. He looks around and discovers a door into a maintenance room! with a thermostat! He pries it open, cuts a cable, and starts wiring the cables into the Raspberry Pi's inputs. Almost done, he hears someone outside about to enter the restroom; he goes out into the restroom as Tyrell enters. Tyrell, at the urinal, remarks "I know you framed Terry Colby ". Elliot stares. "Your father worked at Evil Corp before he died. That's a matter of public record. I'm not turning you in, if that's what you're thinking. I don't care. Just wanted to know your weakness. Now I do. Revenge. How ordinary. Just like our waiter". He takes a little more time to remind Elliot of his ordinariness, and of Tyrell's specialness. Elliot will be driving back to New York, while Tyrell will go by the helicopter. With a final "You take care, Elliot", he leaves. Elliot composes himself, goes back to the maintenance room, finishes wiring the Raspberry Pi, replaces the thermostat cover, and leaves.
Darlene is at fsociety , using her system to chat with someone at the Dark Army . She says she's ready to "sync our payload with yours", but they say, no, it's not happening. She insists, we can run the scripts in 30 seconds, but the Dark Army kicks her from the chat. She tries to reconnect, but she finds out that she is banned. She complains to Trenton for a while on how the Dark Army are "dickless assholes", but she's going to go fix it.
Angela arrives at the house of Donald Moss , her adopted father, and announces that she has broken up with Ollie. Donald is not surprised, he's just gotten off the phone with Ollie, and never liked him anyway. Angela says it's because of money issues, and him cheating. Donald wants to lend her money, and she can stay at home until she has her own apartment.
Tyrell and Joanna Wellick wait for Scott and Sharon Knowles to let them in for dinner. Tyrell says that Joanna had met Scott earlier, he had talked of nothing but wine, so Joanna had tuned him out. They are concerned. The Knowles' seem happy and content with things as they are, and the Wellicks want a way to influence them. Joanna says, "Even if they don't want anything, they will, you have to take away what they already have".
Darlene storms in to a library where Cisco is working, and demands to know why the Dark Army is backing out, and has even banned her from communicating with them. But now that fsociety has done what it planned, the Dark Army has called of their part "like it was nothing". Cisco says, that's her answer. Darlene complains that the " Whiterose " had better off get going and find some courage, but at the name "Whiterose", Cisco rushes to her and stops her from talking further: "don't you care who hears you?" She really wants to know why Dark Army is out of the deal, and Cisco says, really, they were out before fsociety even got to Steel Mountain. His advice to her is to just let it go. He walks away, leaving her stunned. Which causes her to flip out and destroys some books of the library.
The Wellicks have had dinner at the house of the Knowles', and are having after-dinner conversation. Scott seems to talk of nothing but wine, but Sharon seems to have a variety of interests, working in various in- and out-of-government agencies, and always looking for something else. (Aside, Tyrell tells Scott that they've picked him for CTO, which surprises Scott, Tyrell shouldn't be able to know that. Scott: "Would you trust you as your right hand?" Tyrell: "I wouldn't let me in the house".) (Aside, Joanna asks if the house is babyproof, and Sharon glances at Scott and says, it's a consideration.)
The four fsociety guys are in the car driving back to New York. Shayla calls Elliot and says she's getting used to her new job. Elliot tells her he "did what he had to today", and they should get together tonight.
The after-dinner talk has rearranged. While Joanna and Scott are talking about wine, Tyrell quietly asks Sharon, "How did you not blow your brains out being married to him?" She looks at him: "You're a guest in our house. I'll mistake that as a joke in bad taste". She says she's going to the bathroom, and leaves. Joanna nods to Tyrell, who also leaves.
In the bathroom, Sharon is on the toilet with her panties down. Tyrell knocks and enters. Sharon asks "Can I help you?" as she crosses her arms to cover herself. He comes and just stands in front of her, and they look seriously at each other. She uncrosses her arms and shifts back a bit, perhaps so he can see better. Tyrell thanks her for a lovely evening, and leaves. She sighs.
At the fsociety hideout, the guys in the car arrive, filled with success, but Darlene says, well, the Raspberry Pi is online, they could deliver the payload if we wanted but they lost China, the Dark Army bailed. Mr. Robot asks why, and Darlene says they don't answer why's. He's sure they can be coaxed back in, but Darlene says, no, they're gone. (Elliot's phone rings, it's Shayla, he dithers for a moment and she hangs up.) Darlene says, let's do it, and hope that the Dark Army follows. She hurries to a laptop and types in the command, but Mr. Robot stops her. It's pointless to take down the backups, E-Corp will just recover, and we want to kill it, not just hurt it for a while. Darlene is not taking this for an answer, until Elliot comes over and just stands with her, silently, until she closes the laptop. Elliot says they'll rework something, just not tonight. Everyone has been frozen while Darlene ranted, and now they unfreeze, continuing to unpack the car. Elliot invites Darlene to crash at his place.
Elliot remarks to the viewer that, one day, he and his father played hooky from school and went to the beach. When they got home, he dumped the sand out of his shoes. His mother was angry about the mess, but his father talked about the sand, millions of years ago the world moved the sand there, and here today Elliot took it away, he changed the world. In enough trips, Elliot could move all the sand and there would be no beach. Edward said that every day we change the world, but to change the world in a way that matters, takes more time than most people have. It's slow, methodical, exhausting, and we don't all have the stomach for it.
As the viewer listen that remark from Elliot, they see Angela unpacking her stuff at her Dad's house. She comes across papers on a desk, glances through them, and finds a past due hospital bill. More looking, an E-Corp Insurance bill for $25,654. She goes into the closet and finds more papers, armloads, which she dumps on the bed and quickly examines.
Angela goes downstairs, where her dad is reading something, she has a handful of papers in her hand, but she hides them behind her when he notices her. She says she's going out for a run.
Elliot and Darlene have gotten to Elliot's apartment building, and the door to Shayla's apartment is open, the dog is barking. They go in, and only find Shayla's phone lying on the floor, ringing. Elliot picks it up, and it's Vera, saying "Sometimes the universe aligns perfectly. Here I am, locked away. Still, it brings you right to me".
Angela is out running at night. She pauses at a fork in the road.

======================================================================
EPISODE: S1E06
======================================================================

Elliot and Shayla are sitting at a table in a busy neighborhood restaurant. Fernando Vera 's brother, Isaac and Vera's homie D.J , watch from a nearby table. Elliot and Shayla aren't really eating, and not talking of anything important, just being together a little bit. They talk some about the first time they met, and Elliot wishes he could undo what's happened. He promises to get her out of this. Then Isaac announces that time's up. He then drags Shayla from the table and out of the restaurant (as the other diners take little notice). D.J stands over Elliot to keep him from objecting, and leads him to a back room.
In the back room, there's a telephone; Elliot picks it up, and it's Vera on the other end. Vera talks about some research he's done, research on his name and Elliot's: phrases like "brave traveler", "adventurer", "savage" come up. Elliot wants to know where Shayla is being taken, but Vera's mind is on other things: He's impressed with the power Elliot has, and he wants it, and by that he means he wants Elliot to hack him out of jail, today. Elliot says it takes weeks to find security holes, but Vera says it has to be tonight. And when they get back together out of jail, Shayla will be there too, Vera will give Elliot a big hug and they'll all be happy.
Elliot, Isaac, and D.J arrive at Elliot's apartment. Elliot is all worked up about Shayla, but Isaac wants him to concentrate on nothing but getting Vera out. As he looks at the documentation for the prison's control system, Elliot remarks to the viewers, that hacking a prison network isn't impossible, most are regular industrial control systems. Isaac and D.J are just hanging around, occasionally wondering what Elliot is good for, and whether he can do the job he's been ordered to do.
Elliot is curious about Isaac, something bugs him; he uses a wifi scanner tool, and finds a signal named "Isaac's S5 phone".
Angela is alone at Allsafe , it's before working time, nobody's there but her, and she's looking at the online article "Did Colby implicate himself?" She's also looking at the materials from the family's lawsuit from long ago, then she's printing out Terry Colby emails from the fsociety data dump, and going through and adding notes. That done, she gets a list of law firms, and starts calling them, asking each about the Washington Township scandal. She spends a while at this, getting nobody to talk to her, until she gets to attorney Antara Nayar . Now Allsafe employees are starting to arrive, but Angela sees that Antara Nayar has sent her a text; she gets her coat and leaves.
Outside the prison, Darlene is wandering around the parking lot, scattering flash drives on the ground.
Angela is meeting Antara Nayar in her office; Antara represented the 25 families of victims of the Washington Township case , one of which was Angela's mother. Antara says after the case was dismissed, she took eight years to rebuild her career. Angela wants her to reopen the case, with the new data that Angela has brought, but Antara dismisses the collection of "internet gossip" and amateur research. She turns Angela's attention to several clients in the waiting room, all serious criminals, but Antara will have an easier case defending them than if she again tried to attack E-Corp .
Outside the prison, an arriving officer notices the flash drives on the ground, and picks up one. We can see Darlene watching from a distance. Inside, the officer sticks the drive into a computer. It looks like he's in a security center, with many monitors on the walls. His computer shows him windows, offering him a free eTunes gift card, and he happily answers its innocuous questions ... until he gets a popup from the computer's malware detection system, it detected malware in the eTunes software. The officer is immediately anxious, first pulling out the flash drive, then pulling the power plug on the computer.
At Elliot's apartment, his desktop displays "Connection closed by remote host", he says he was in for a moment, but then the exploit stopped. Isaac slaps him and asks what's going on, but Elliot says he needs to take the dog for a walk. After Elliot leaves, D.J gets up and watches from the window as Elliot walks out of sight.
Elliot meets Darlene a block away, and complains that the exploit didn't work. She says, well, she only had an hour, it was all she could do, and he gave her no time to do it right. She's ready to walk away, but Elliot says Isaac and D.J are sitting on him, and he has to get this solved right away. Darlene is not impressed, but then D.J shows up. He shows them his gun, and waves them back to towards the apartment.
Antara Nayar still isn't willing to work further on the case, when Angela asks, "hypothetically", what it would take to make a case. Antara says it would take a reliable eye witness, an insider, who was there when the decisions were made. She doesn't think Angela knows anyone like that.
In an E-Corp meeting room, Scott Knowles is meeting senior employees, when Tyrell Wellick comes in. Tyrell says Scott should just skip the interviews and play golf with him, but Scott says he sees what's going on. Tyrell wanted to be CTO, he's not, and he's pissed. So Tyrell is trying to mess things up for Scott, but Scott says it won't work, he even knows the suggestions that went on between Tyrell and Scott's wife , she told him all about it. But Scott wants Tyrell to really get the idea. He's not going to be CTO, ever, so he doesn't need to play these "silly games".
Elliot is still researching, with Isaac and D.J watching over him and Darlene, when the doorbell rings, it's Angela. Though everyone ignores her, she keeps calling for Elliot to let her in, so Isaac lets Elliot go out and get rid of her.
Tyrell is at home with Joanna , he's furiously angry, while she is calm and confident. Joanna had told Tyrell that Scott was dangerous, and he is. Tyrell says he's at risk now, he has to pull back and remain patient. But Joanna reminds him that "patient" does not mean "cowardly". He has to take advantage of the opening that Sharon Knowles gave him. Sharon wants to be wanted.
Elliot meets Angela outside, and she says she's met with her lawyer, and has an idea on how to press the suit against E-Corp. She doesn't want to go into the details, which is fine with Elliot, he has urgent stuff to deal with that isn't her business, so he tells her to trust herself. She asks about Shayla, to which Elliot vaguely answers, and she leaves.
Elliot goes back up the stairs towards his apartment, and finds Mr. Robot waiting for him on the stairs. Mr. Robot warns Elliot that this thing he's doing for Vera, it can't work out well, it probably won't succeed, and whether it does or doesn't Vera's homies will probably kill both Elliot and Shayla anyway. Elliot says there's got to be a way, and he'll find it. Mr. Robot reminds him about fsociety, it's a success, and Elliot can do so much more with them, but this deal with Vera, it's failure.
Back at Elliot's apartment, he walks in full of purpose. He stuffs his laptop and other tools into his backpack, and says "I'm ready to bust Vera out". He needs to get to the jail, now, he wants Darlene to stay, but Isaac is having none of that, everyone is going.
On the way to the jail, Elliot thinks about how he misses his old life. "Remember when the panic would set in and we had a solution?" And now he has both Shayla and Darlene to rescue from Vera and his homies. Parked near the jail, Elliot gets out and marches in, quickly typing on his cellphone, thinking "My mind is frayed.... I can feel the static running through my brain".
Now Elliot is in the jail's busy visiting area, across the table from Vera. Elliot says he needs more time, but Vera says it has to be tonight. Elliot explains that, actually, he and Vera have to sit here and talk, because right now his cell phone is sniffing and detecting any sort of wireless network in sight, and then he'll own the network. Vera says, brave but stupid, when he springs Vera everyone will look to the security recording of this meeting and go after Elliot, but Elliot says he'll open all the cells at once, no problem. But, he knows, once Vera is free, he's going to need to run, and with his money too. Elliot has hacked Isaac's phone, and has hacked Vera's entire operation, crew, shipments, all of it, Elliot owns it. So he needs Vera's word: once this is done, Vera and his homies will leave both Elliot and Shayla alone, or else Elliot will leak his information. And in case Elliot just gets killed, he's arranged to leak it if he doesn't disable it every 24 hours. Vera doesn't look happy, but seems to accept it. He then tells him that he will hug him.
Angela tries to visit Terry Colby in his city townhouse. He doesn't want to be visited, nor dosen't want to talk to anyone.
Outside the prison, Elliot looks at his phone's snooping app, and it shows nothing but WPA2-protected networks. He thinks: "Borderline unhackable". But he stops and looks around at the parking lot, and runs another app, scanning for bluetooth transmitters, and finds one in a nearby police car. He realizes he doesn't need to hack WPA2, when there's a dedicated bluetooth network he can get into.
Elliot arrives at the car where the others are waiting: "We're good. I can pull this off". He's ready to get going, but Isaac pulls Elliot into the car, tells everyone else out, and drives off for a private talk.
Elliot and Isaac walk along the river, and Elliot is explaining, he's ready, he can free Vera, and if he doesn't he can kill Vera's operation. Isaac stops him and points his gun at him, Isaac is anxious, but Elliot is calm and understanding: Isaac doesn't want Vera free, he wants to have Vera dead, tonight, and the first thing Vera will do is to kill Isaac. Isaac is worried and puts down the gun. Elliot says Vera is all set either way, he's got protection inside, and if Isaac doesn't get him out, he'll have Isaac killed just for that. So Isaac's best choice is to let Elliot get Vera out, then Isaac can do whatever he wants. Isaac says, "What makes you think I still won't kill you afterwards?" Elliot replies, "I don't. I'm just playing my best move". Isaac puts the gun away, and they go back to the car.
Elliot explains to Isaac that he needs about a minute with the patrol car's bluetooth connection, and he'll have the exploit into the main prison control system, which will open all the cell doors at 9:49 PM. Darlene, dressed suggestively, approaches the officer in the car, and engages him in conversation. While she is keeping his attention on her, we can see windows pop up on the patrol car's laptop display, and we can see Elliot typing in commands. Elliot thinks, the exploit's in the laptop, now to get it into the jail. Elliot announces that he's paused the exploit, and they should drive away.
The police car gets a bulletin of an alarm going off, but Darlene keeps the officer distracted so he pays no attention.
In their car, Isaac points his gun at Elliot. Elliot says, "I only need to press one key to run the expliot. Or, I can press another and disable the entire plan. I made my move. You make yours".
The officer turns away from Darlene and notices the windows up on the laptop; he tries to type commands, but nothing works. The officer says he has to get back; Darlene walks away as the officer is calling in, "My computer's on the fritz".
Isaac lowers his gun and says they should go to the meet. They drive away. Elliot remarks to the viewer, if he made any mistake, the cell doors won't open, and he knows what that will mean. But doesn't make mistakes.
Night outside the prison, Isaac, D.J and Elliot are standing outside the fence. It's time. Isaac gets out his gun and tells D.J it's just in case some prisoner rushes them. There's noise, alarms, the screech of metal doors opening, and the campus lights go off. Elliot tells them it's from the power surge of opening all the doors at once, but the prison control system should still be saying all the cells are locked and closed, so the alarms will turn off. The lights come on again, and we can see prisoners boiling out from the buildings, headed towards the fence. They get through the fence door, and split in every direction, but it's Vera who walks to the three.
Vera tells them that this is just what he needs. Then he tells D.J to "shoot the cocksucker", and D.J shoots Isaac, who falls down dead. Vera says, that's right, he's his brother's keeper, and now "like Cain after Abel, I'll be a fugitive and wanderer on the earth". He thanks Elliot for his bravery, but tells him, his operation is over, Elliot can burn it to the ground, it doesn't matter he's gone.
A car drives up and stops next to them. As Vera and D.J move to get in, Elliot asks where Shayla is. Vera gets the keys to Isaac's car from D.J and tosses them to Elliot: "You just didn't realize she was with you the whole time". Vera and D.J drive off, leaving Elliot next to Isaac's car. He opens the trunk, and finds out that Shayla is dead, lying there. Elliot turns around, not quite crying, then definitely crying. We see the lights of police cars flashing around. He pulls up his hood and runs away.

EPISODE: S1E07
======================================================================

This was then, Elliot comes home and starts setting up a line of morphine, when he hears sounds from a new girl moving in next door, she calls herself Shayla , and dashes in for help. She needs a glass of water to save her black beta fish . She sits down on his couch, notices the line of morphine, and says to let her know if he wants a "top-shelf hookup". She asks his help in moving a dresser, and then they later go outside.
Elliot and Shayla make some awkward small talk. Elliot asks if Shayla can get Suboxone , her supplier doesn't have it, but she knows someone else who might. They take a few steps in getting to know each other, Shayla making the most effort. Oh, and Elliot can keep the fish.
That was then, and this is now. Elliot meets with Krista , thinking it's been a month since Shayla died, and he's annoyed that he's starting to get over her. Krista has some forms for him to sign, they say that he has completed the time with her that he needs. Elliot thinks she's trying to get rid of him. He wonders how much time he's spent with her and not listening to her. Krista says she does want him to keep coming, "We've got a lot more work to do", but Elliot gives her the signed papers and walks out.
Angela and Antara Nayar meet up with four lawyers working for Terry Colby . Angela wants a meeting with Colby, with no lawyers but Antara, to discuss information that Angela won't divulge but believes is beneficial to Colby. The lawyers are sceptical, but agree to pass the offer on to Colby.
Elliot is in Gideon 's office at Allsafe , and Gideon wants to offer Elliot some time off, to get over Shayla's death, Elliot feels that he doesn't need anything. Gideon advises him to find someone he can be his "honest self with". Elliot spends a while dreaming. In the old days of the web, kids like him could find someone else's website, view the source, and copy it into a new website, easy, so, what if you could "view source" on people? He imagines the other people in the office, with signs around their necks: "I got a nose job", "I pretend to love my husband", "I'm empty inside". Elliot finds the advice to find an "honest self" silly, but he thanks Gideon and leaves.
Darlene and Mr. Robot are in a bar, she is drinking and he is reading a paper. He's impressed by a story about "the hacker group fsociety ", it's like they made an impact, and he thinks they should get the Dark Army working. Darlene says she's tried, no go, they are experts and can't be hacked. Anyway, the tape backups are now in place, they have no way to get around that. Mr. Robot says that he's got a plan in motion.
Elliot is in his apartment, burning a CD with all of his Shayla files. "This is all I have left of her. I will miss her. I need to wipe again". He unplugs the computer's components, pulls the memory sticks, the hard drive, and carries the memory sticks to the kitchen to microwave. Unnoticed, a microSD card falls from the pile in his hands, and his dog snaps it back up.
Tyrell Wellick is meeting in his office with three of his executives, he's not paying much attention as they talk casually about budgets and earnings, and then gossip about lower-level executives who "go gay to move up the ladder", and others who "go cock jockey" for promotion. Tyrell looks like he heard that, and asks one of the executives about his children. After getting a response. Tyrell yells "You're fired!" Everyone is stunned, silent, then they smile, it must have been a joke. Tyrell says, "You two as well. I'm making sure you all receive the minimum severance packages". When the executives ask what they did, Tyrell shrugs: "Nothing".
Angela walks into Antara's office, and learns that Colby's lawyers wanted a promise of "total immunity" before the meeting, and Antara has just arranged that. So that Colby has agreed to meet privately with Angela. But Antara warns Angela, this may not be a good idea, she'll be in the home of a very powerful man, with a lot at stake.
Mr. Robot visits Leslie Romero at his home, he's been busy making up THC-based skin cream, he's got lots of clients. Mr. Robot wants Romero back into the fsociety project, but Romero considers it as a wasted effort. Mr. Robot alternates between threatening and cajoling Romero, and eventually Romero seems to accept that he has to get back with the group.
Angela meets with Terry Colby at his house, and he is initially dismissive of her, just asking how much money she wants. She says she has information than can help him, if he can testify about the E-Corp executive meetings that dealt with the hazardous waste issue. He is mostly obscene in his responses. He gets up to leave, but Angela stops him with the idea that, if he leaves, people will be left with the idea that he's guilty, and he'll lose their respect, and she is a way for him to get out of that.
Elliot has taken the dog, named Flipper, to the veterinarian. She scans the microchip on Flipper's back, to satisfy her housekeeping, and then she looks at the xrays. Flipper seems to have eaten something, perhaps trash, that is big enough to upset her insides. She will keep Flipper for a few days until it passes normally.
Angela is walking along the sidewalk, when her phone rings, it's Antara, Colby's lawyers called and said that Colby had agree to talk, right now.
Darlene meets Cisco at the library, and Cisco is still pissed, Darlene's attempts to lean on the Whiterose left Cisco looking like an expendable foot soldier. She hacked into Cisco's system and used Cisco's credentials on chat to talk to the Dark Army. So he doesn't want to see her again, but the Dark Army says the meeting's on.
Angela meets Colby at his house again, and he's going to provide the testimony, but he wonders what's in it for her? She doesn't actually answer, but asks again the question she asked before: was Colby at meetings where the hazardous waste issue was discussed? He says, yes, many of them. The issue wasn't a big deal for them, it wasn't a vile assemblage of gloating evil conspirators, it was just board meetings, people running a business. Sure, there was some realization that this wasn't the "right" thing, but then they moved on down the agenda.
The executives of E-Corp, and families, are meeting at night in a festive room, as Phillip Price toasts Scott Knowles as the new Chief Technology Officer. People mingle, many getting in line to congratulate Scott. In the background are Tyrell and Joanna Wellick . He is stealing himself for something, and she encourages him as she sends him off. Tyrell meets up with Sharon Knowles at the bar, and she expresses disappointment at how he still seems sore about what happened a month ago. Tyrell makes a bold suggestion, meet him, tonight, in his office, or better, the roof, the back stairwell cameras are out. She doesn't reply, but walks away.
Angela is in Gideon's office at Allsafe, and she recognizes that she needs to be fired, but his concern is that her revelations will ruin Allsafe, nobody will want to do business with them. And Angela needs to feel for the fates of all the Allsafe employees that will go down with it.
Sharon Knowles meets Tyrell on the roof, and they banter a bit. She says she came to see if Tyrell was really as gullible as he seems, with her husband downstairs getting the job that Tyrell wants. Anyway, she feels he's playing the game poorly. He says Sharon really needs Tyrell because she's dissatisfied with Scott, but she feels Tyrell is just desperate to cling to any chance to stay at E-Corp once Scott takes over. Tyrell grabs her and kisses her, and she kisses back. They go to the ground, kissing and groping, and he wraps his hands around her neck and starts to strangle her. She tries to yell, tries to struggle, but eventually she chokes and is later unconscious. Tyrell gets up, panting and sobbing. He stumbles away a few feet, then comes back to wipe her neck with a cloth. Then he runs away.
It's day, and Darlene meets Trenton outside. The plan with the Dark Army is back on, and Darlene needs Trenton to be back with the group. Trenton wonders what it is that motivates Darlene, and Darlene has no real answer, she just knows that somehow they've gotten together with the tools and the people to do the right thing, right now.
Cisco waits by a storefront until Ollie walks by, and Cisco follows. Ollie is put out of shape by this, and wants Cisco gone, but Cisco says Ollie is in no condition to complain. Ollie put a malicious CD into his work system, and Cisco and his fellas know it. Ollie just wants out of whatever this is, but Cisco says Ollie has to do what he's told, or "the giant shit storm that rains turds will leave a trail of clouds in the sky spelling out your name". Ollie nods.
Elliot goes and meets Krista at her office, it's before office hours but she lets him in. After she confirms that what he says will be kept confidential, he admits some things: He's been lying to her all along. He doesn't actually take his pills, but Krista doesn't either. He's been keeping track of her online presence, she bought a hazelnut latte this morning, she texted her sister about it, she's not good with money, she seems to be encouraging her Thursday 2:00 to leave her husband, she's tired of being dumped. She cries sometimes, just like Elliot. He says he doesn't just hack her, he hacks everyone, his friends and coworkers. But he wants a way out of loneliness, just as Krista does. "Is that what you wanted to hear?"

======================================================================
EPISODE: S1E08
======================================================================

It's morning in a nice apartment, and on the balcony is Darlene , with little in the way of clothing, looking out on the city. Her hookup, Xander Jones , already well dressed, comes out and holds her a bit. She talks a little about, "what if a revolution happened?" He's not into that sort of thing, he gets paid a lot to deal with problems. It's time for him to go off to work, he kisses her and leaves.
Once he's out of the door, Darlene comes back inside and searches the apartment for any hidden cabinets. She finds a safe hidden under the bar. Xander's MBA diploma is nearby on a wall, she puts in the graduation date as a combination... and the safe opens. Inside, she pays no attention to anything but a handgun, which she takes and puts it into her purse.
Darlene walks into a ballet studio, with lots of women stretching and practicing, and one of them is Angela . She's on the phone (" Ollie ... I don't care who you ran into or what he said,"), but hangs up as Darlene joins her, they are clearly old childhood friends. Angela assures Darlene that she's not getting back together with Ollie, he just has some work stuff to deal with. They discuss how Elliot's getting along. "He's had a shitty month". "Or twenty years". The ballet teacher arrives, and Angela and Darlene take their places in the class.
Elliot is thinking about Krista , and how he hurt her. "I don't feel good about that. I hope you're not mad at me". Elliot is burning a CD with his desktop's "Krista Gordon" folder, which he then deletes. He labels all of his hacked-person data CD's with the name of an album. Krista's gets labeled "Talking Heads Speaking in Tongues", and he adds it to his collection of CD's. He spends a while looking through the web page for AirDream Advanced Metering, they provide modern building automation services.
Elliot goes out onto the street and meets Mr. Robot . Elliot asks if Mr. Robot got everybody back, and Mr. Robot nods.
Darlene is on the subway, it's rather crowded, but she notices two asian men a little way down the car, looking directly at her. One nods to the other, and they get up and walk over to stand right in front of her, she puts her hand in her purse. One says, as if to his partner, "Tell him to follow the proper commands, or the sequence won't initiate". They both walk away down the car, and Darlene looks after them.
At the fsociety hideout, Elliot is telling everyone his plans. He remotely patched the software in the Raspberry Pi that he had planted in Steel Mountain , he's been monitoring it daily, it's all ready. His malware has been planted at all five of the Steel Mountain locations. They all use AirDream control systems for HVAC, and they are all networked together, so fsociety will arrange to heat all of the locations at the same time, while making sure no alarms go off from the temperature rise. Elliot gets a text from Lloyd Chong : " Allsafe 's been hacked".
Elliot needs to get to Allsafe, but then Darlene arrives to say that the Dark Army are following her, and probably will follow him as well. She hands him her gun, saying those guys are dangerous, and the meet with the Whiterose might not go as he wants. Elliot gives back the gun, he doesn't know how to use them. Darlene grabs his phone and dials herself from it, so they both have each others' number, that's not fsociety protocol, but she says he needs this now. Elliot leaves, and Darlene hides the gun in a popcorn machine in the hideout.
As Elliot leaves fsociety, Mr. Robot catches up with him, to say he should forget Darlene's number. But he's sure that the Whiterose wants to talk to Elliot, and he can't afford any distractions.
Tyrell Wellick is walking rather in a haze through the E-Corp executive hallways, he gets easily distracted by conversations, and walks into a fellow exec and spills his coffee. His assistant, Elizabeth , catches up with him. He tells her he's busy, cancel all meetings and hold all calls, but she says that Gideon Goddard is already in the office waiting to see Tyrell.
Gideon tells Tyrell that an employee broke the chain of custody with the Colby data file, so it can't be used as evidence against Colby. But Allsafe is putting in place many measures to find the hackers, such as setting up a honeypot for server CS30, the one that fsociety used for its last attack. At the mention of CS30, Tyrell is sweating, but Gideon goes on, Allsafe will ensure that fsociety can't cause any more damage. Just at that moment, Gideon gets a text from Lloyd Chong: "Call the office! 911! Entire network down". Tyrell makes noises of understanding Gideon's concerns, and thanks him for giving the problem his entire attention. They shake hands, and Gideon leaves.
As soon as Gideon is gone, Tyrell turns to his keyboard, and makes an ssh connection to server CS30, or presumably its honeypot. He searches for directories for which he has no access, and looks over the list, staring at one called "fd1info". He looks into that directory, and stares for a while at one file on the list, "fsociety". But then he is interrupted by his assistant. The police are here, there was a body found on the roof last night, and detectives want to speak with Tyrell. Tyrell gets up and says work has to go on, the detectives can make an appointment to talk with him, but for now he needs to talk with the Dulles server farm. He walks out of his office.
At the Allsafe offices, Gideon has gotten back, and is assigning tasks to various employees to get things running again. He tells Ollie to cancel all appointments, no customers can hear about this. He goes into the server room, just as Elliot shows up for work. Gideon and Elliot look at each other for a moment, then Elliot gets to work.
Elliot is looking at logs on his system, and commenting to the viewer. This hack is no big deal, the hackers already have a lot of control of the company systems but aren't doing anything actually valuable, it's like they are making a distraction, something that will keep Allsafe engineers busy while something else goes on.
Then Ollie comes by, and he seems nervous as he gives Elliot an assignment. Take these two disk drives to Blank's Disk Recovery to be destroyed, and right now. Elliot objects, he's working on the malware now, but Ollie pulls rank, Elliot has to do this right now, it's noon and the appointment at Blank's is at 2 PM, go get this done.
Elliot is curious about Ollie's nervousness, and hacks into the Allsafe mail system to look at Ollie's mail. His most recent Sent Mail has lots of messages to Angela, with subjects like "I'm on the verge of tears", and "This hack is your fault!" Elliot wonders what Angela has to do with this.
Tyrell is back at home with Joanna , and she's surprised, there's a gala tonight. She's sure that, last night, he slept with Sharon Knowles , and took pictures that they can use for blackmail against Scott Knowles . Tyrell says blackmail is too unpredictable, they have to find another way. She says blackmail is perfect, it would raise a scandal, and the company wouldn't allow a scandal during the earnings report, so Scott will resign and Phillip will name Tyrell as CTO. Tyrell has no answers for her and says nothing. She says, "Don't unravel now".
On the street, Elliot runs into Angela, and complains that she didn't tell him about what was going on with Ollie, Elliot could have helped. Angela says Elliot's not been around to help anyone for a month. Anyway, she says "some guy" gave Ollie a CD that infected his laptop, and the guy forced Ollie to run a disk at Allsafe, so that got done, a while ago. Elliot remarks to the viewers. I was right, the hack was a distraction, this is something set up by the Dark Army and something to do with me and this meeting. Angela is still bothered, Elliot hasn't been himself for several months, even before Shayla .
Elliot gets to the storefront of Blank's Disk Recovery. He thinks that the Dark Army has taken extraordinary steps to make sure this meeting's exactly how they want it. He goes in and gives his name.
Someone leads Elliot to a glass-walled room, and Elliot remarks to the viewer on how it is a Faraday cage, a room where no radio signals go in or out. Inside the room, there is a guy in a hazmat suit, eating a sandwich. The door is open, and Elliot walks in. As he does so, the guy walks out and closes the door behind him. Another door opens, and walks in is the Whiterose, an asian trans woman. She demands the disk drives that Elliot has, and starts to disassemble them. She looks at her watch, and says that she manages her time very carefully, she has allotted Elliot three minutes.
He starts to talk about the drives, then about the E-Corp hack that fsociety has ready to run, but the Whiterose dismisses such topics, they waste precious time telling her things she already knows. He asks if the Dark Army is ready to do their part, and the Whiterose says it's fsociety that is not ready. If they failed to have a worthwhile focus, first the hack to target Terry Colby, then the vulnerability that raised the suspicion of Gideon Goddard. So Gideon has made a honeypot of the hacked server. Elliot says he'll get rid of the honeypot, but the Whiterose says she's not inspired with confidence, until a few seconds ago Elliot didn't even know there was a honeypot. Now the Whiterose sets a deadline. Elliot has 50 hours and 23 minutes to disable the honeypot, and then the Dark Army will initiate the hack. She says Elliot will never see her again, and she walks out.
Elliot hurries along the sidewalk back to Allsafe, thinking on what he has to accomplish. He has to get the honeypot down, Gideon has been spying on Elliot, and it's Gideon who has the credentials to get the honeypot turned off. He realizes that he needs a distraction so he can get to Gideon's phone, he calls Darlene and records a message for her.
Back at his office desk, Elliot looks across the room to where Gideon is doing something on his phone. Elliot goes to the coffee pot, just as Gideon looks at the phone, plugs it into its charger, and leaves it on his desk. Elliot remarks to us about how he got a hundred large files transmitted to Gideon's phone, draining the battery. Elliot gets out his own phone, and texts someone a message: "Go".
In the conference room off of the desk area, there is a large TV set, and it starts displaying another of those fsociety videos, with a masked figure making pronouncements: "Corporate greed is a trickle down desire that reaches even the bottom of the food chain. And for what?" It's loud enough that all of the employees can hear it, and all of them rush to the conference to see what's going on. Except for Elliot. The video is specifically against Allsafe, and Gideon Goddard, and says that Allsafe's nightmare is about to begin, the sweet dreams are over, et cetera, et cetera, you will soon be finished. Some in the room are checking their phones. The video is also on YouTube, and on the Allsafe website.
But while everyone's attention is on the video, Elliot slips unseen into Gideon's office; he taps on it, ending with a display showing a code number. Elliot thinks that the passcode is only good for 90 seconds, he has to log in with it on his computer in that time. Elliot quickly walks to his desk. Just as Gideon, with the others in the conference room, looks around and says, "Where's Elliot?"
Gideon hurries across the room to where Elliot is sitting at his desk. Elliot types the passcode into the login screen for the IT Admin ticket system, logging in as Gideon, and he iconifies the window just in time for Gideon to not see it as he arrives at Elliot's desk. Gideon says he's quite suspicious of Elliot. All these events have been happening around Elliot's appearances and disappearances, and now, there's a disaster going on, every employee was in that room seeing it, and Elliot was off doing something else? Elliot has nothing to say. Gideon wants answers, but gets pulled away. E-Corp is on the phone, right now. Gideon goes, but says he's "not finished" with Elliot.
Elliot had indeed gotten logged in to the ticket system in time, and he finds the tickets Gideon used to establish the honeypot. He types in a new ticket: "Please remove honeypot and restore normal connectivity on server CS30". He remarks to viewer: When he hacked Gideon, and his secrets, he saw a good, honest man, Gideon is wrong, because Elliot really is "finished" here, he's not good for Allsafe or its people. He knows Gideon is protecting his people, but Elliot is doing this "to protect everyone".
Tyrell is in his limo, parked outside the fsociety hideout, talking with Mr. Robot. Tyrell knows fsociety has been busy, and wants to know what's planned, they and he are supposed to be allies. Mr. Robot disagrees, there's nothing they could agree on. Tyrell says he has a hold over Mr. Robot, Tyrell knows "your dirty little secret". Mr. Robot says they shouldn't be petty, and once Tyrell thinks about it, he'll realize that telling anyone about "that" does neither of us any good, and the only thing for Tyrell to do in his position is nothing.
Tyrell gets home, and immediately picks up a bottle and drinks deeply. Joanna notices, and says it doesn't inspire her confidence. She had heard that the gala was cancelled, and that maybe Tyrell had accomplished something last night, though he won't tell her what. Tyrell says it doesn't matter anymore, he and she have been blinded by focusing on the "wrong players". He says some months ago he met a tech guy, Tyrell thought he could use him to get something, but now he realizes that the tech could be the step to something grander and more beautiful: God. Joanna is dumbfounded.
At that point, the doorbell rings, and it's two detectives, Quattlander and Jones . They are investigating the murder at E-Corp, and want to talk to both of them. Tyrell tries to derail this, saying they should make an appointment at the office, but the detectives say this is a time sensitive matter, and they have questions that need answers. First, they ask, did the Wellick's know the deceased, Sharon Knowles? This floors Joanna: "Sharon Knowles? That's terrible. Yes, yes, we did know her". She invites the detectives in.
Inside, she offers the detectives coffee, they accept, and she goes to the kitchen. The detectives sit down with Tyrell, and ask him when did he last saw Sharon Knowles. Tyrell just sits and stares, long enough that the detectives ask whether he's all right. Then they all hear a groan from the kitchen. They rush in, and Joanna is leaning against a counter, there's a pool of blood on the floor between her legs. Tyrell says he thinks the baby is coming, they need to go the hospital. Jones starts calling on his phone. Tyrell notices, sitting on the kitchen counter, a 2-tined fork with blood on the end. He looks at her, wordlessly, and she says (in Swedish): "I will not let them take you. You will not leave us".
Night at Coney Island, and Elliot is sitting with Darlene. Darlene says the hack of the climate control system is all set up. They agree, they've done it, in 43 hours, exactly, the honeypot will go away, and her rootkit will take down Evil Corp. Darlene is ecstatic, Elliot really got them to do something worthwhile, and she says "I love you so much". At that, he leans forward and kisses her.
Darlene immediately pulls back in disgust: "what the hell is wrong with you?" Elliot sputters and apologizes, he's confused. "Oh my god, Elliot. Did you forget again? Did you forget who I am? Tell me who you think I am". Elliot is surprised: "You're Darlene. You're Darlene!" But Elliot thinks to the viewers: "I know. I know what she's going to say". She starts to say it: "I'm your..." and he finishes it: "Sister. You're my sister". He steps back, puts up his hood, and walks away.
Elliot makes his way home via subway, in a haze of "I remember Darlene", and "I'm crazy", and "Why did I forget?", and "I'm crazy". "Were you in on this the whole time?"
He gets to his apartment, still terribly confused. "Is this amnesia? What else am I not remembering? I should have stayed on the meds. I'm crazy. I should never have created you. Do I even exist?" The phone rings, he glances at it, then throws it across the room. He sits at the computer, uses a search website to find himself, nothing comes up. He tries the other search engines and people finders, no sign of the "Elliot Alderson" of New York who works with computers. "Nothing. No identity. I'm a ghost. Did I erase myself?" He goes to his CD folder and pages through them, reading some of the labels, glancing at a few and tossing them aside. He finds the first CD on the case, it has no label or name written on it, it's blank.
He puts the CD in his machine, and the folders appear. He pages through a directory of pictures, lots of pictures of a man who looks exactly like Mr. Robot, dressed differently, who seems to be an ordinary, smiling, relaxed man. Then there are pictures of this man, and the boy that Elliot remembers as him when he was young, this could be that they had father-and-son pictures? Lots of happy pictures of them doing things together. He remembers something, he gets up and finds on one of his shelves a picture, it's a family foursome picture, Dad (?), the woman Elliot remembers as his mother , his young self, and a young girl. Is it his family? There's a pounding on the door. It's Mr. Robot: "I think we should talk".

EPISODE: S1E09
======================================================================

A flashback to a computer and accessories store, owner Edward Alderson sitting at the desk, with a calendar for October 1994 nearby. His jacket says " Mr. Robot ", and that's the name of his store. He gets a call from a customer, suggests a few options to upgrade his system, and invites him to bring it in. Then a dissatisfied customer comes in, when he was there earlier, buying something, Edward's son stole a $20 bill from the money he had on the counter. He wants his money, and an apology, but he is snooty enough about it that Edward just says "No... I'm gonna have to ask you to leave". The customer sputters for a while, tosses out a few insults, and says he'll take his business to Best Buy. But he leaves.
Edward sighs, and asks his son, young Elliot , to come out from the back room. Elliot says he didn't do it, but when Edward puts out his hand, Elliot gives him the $20 bill. So... Edward picks up the movies section of the paper, and suggests a movie they could go to together. Elliot goes to get his jacket, and Edward spends a while coughing. When Elliot comes back, he asks his father why he's not in trouble. Edward says, "Even though what you did was wrong, you're still a good kid, and that guy was a prick. Sometimes that matters more". They lock up the store and head to the movies.
Today. Mr. Robot has come to Elliot's apartment, and Elliot is beside himself, his father is alive! And here with him again! Mr. Robot is all casual about it, but then Elliot is enraged: "Why didn't you tell me?" Mr. Robot explains, they had important stuff to get done, and he had to handle Elliot "gently" to finish, and he also needs Elliot to be quiet now. Elliot starts yelling again, this is the right voice to use "20 years after your supposed death", and Mr. Robot gets him to quiet down, we don't want "them" to hear us. Looking outside, Mr. Robot and Elliot do see at the curb a black van, and two men in suits, sort of watching Elliot's apartment.
Mr. Robot explains, the people out there don't want him alive, "they" want Elliot to keep taking his pills, to forget his own sister, to stay under control, and to keep Mr. Robot from existing. Elliot wants answers, about himself, about Darlene , about Mr. Robot, but Mr. Robot says, it's not safe to discuss it here, Elliot needs to follow Mr. Robot to get the answers. They leave.
Gideon Goddard is at home, getting dressed, and his partner, Harry Davis , is trying to calm him down, and to get him to share what's going on. Gideon explains that, as everyone knows, Allsafe got hacked, and for many companies it's a nuisance, but for a security company it's a disaster. He doesn't know how they can survive, if they can keep their customers. Gideon feels like a failure, but Harry says, this relationship they have, that's not what failure looks like.
Antara Nayar is in her office, assigning tasks to her assistants, when Angela walks in. Antara says the research is going great, and Angela says she came to help, since she no longer has a job. Antara says Angela can't work here, it's not Antara's job to give Angela's purpose in life, she should go find something else to do.
Outside the office, Angela's phone rings, and it's Darlene, she's looking for Elliot, and she's worried that he's "flipping out again". Angela was the one who helped him the last time he was like this, so they agree to go together.
They meet at the museum with the big map of New York City. It's a place Angela remembers where she and Elliot would always go when he ran away. But he's not there, and Angela has no insight on his whereabouts. Darlene is worried that Elliot is in serious mental trouble, but Angela wonders, why Darlene should care, it's like the two siblings were never that close, Darlene says she has to help, he's her brother, but Angela feels there's something else "really" going on, and if Darlene won't talk about it, fine, but she doesn't need Angela's help.
Elliot and Mr. Robot are waiting for a train to New Jersey. Elliot says he doesn't know where they are going, but "they" may be after Darlene. There's a man in a black suit nearby, who initially looks suspiciously interested in Elliot... until they see his interest was in another woman among the passengers. Mr. Robot says they can't see Darlene right now, it's too risky, but he'll show Elliot "exactly where I've been this whole time".
On the train, Elliot thinks: "I'll figure this out. I know you don't trust me. I'm remembering more and more". He hopes that once he gets the answers, he'll be back to normal, except for his dead father not being dead.
In a hospital room, Joanna Wellick is in bed, with the newborn baby in a carrier next to it, and Tyrell is there also. She talks about how much she loves the new baby, and also how she loved her first, a girl, born when she was fifteen years old. Tyrell is surprised, it's news to him, but she talks about filling out lots of forms, and passing the baby off to new parents. Tyrell says she should have told him, he loves her, but she says, "You are not a man I want to be married to any longer.... If you want to remain in this family you'll fix this".
Gideon Goddard approaches Blank's Disk, and discovers it to be a burned-out shell, surrounded by fire fighters and police tape. He talks to the owner, who was away for one day, and came back to find everything gone. Gideon is there for some drives, but everything was burned up.
Tyrell gets to his office, to find Phillip Price waiting for him. Phillip asks, and Tyrell says, it was a boy. Anyway, Price says E-Corp is in a delicate state, and the situation with Sharon Knowles is horrific, Scott is understandably devastated. But the police have indicated that Tyrell is a person of interest. Price understands, Scott and Tyrell had competitive frictions, and that Scott nabbed the CTO position away from Tyrell, and it's natural for Scott to lash out at Tyrell. But, Scott will remain at E-Corp, and Tyrell can't. Tyrell is enraged, saying how he's killed himself for the company, how he was promoted faster than any, and such. Phillip is frankly disappointed by Tyrell's response, it could have gone a different way, but it didn't. His advice to Tyrell is to look back at his recent past, find "a mistake, a compulsion, decision, something, that led you to this point right now", and go recognize it and deal with this failure.
Tyrell is walking along the E-Corp hallways, and is approached again by police detectives, they still want answers. He tells them to talk to his lawyers, and walks out.
Elliot and Mr. Robot have broken into the old house the family once had, Elliot has led Mr. Robot to his old bedroom upstairs. He goes to the window to the back yard, and comments that that was where "it" happened. Mr. Robot doesn't get it, so Elliot grabs him and pushes him through the window, breaking it, and leaving Mr. Robot suspended, half out the window. Elliot says, that's what Mr. Robot did: "you pushed me out this window; you pushed me off the boardwalk". Mr. Robot says to calm down, it was an accident, but Elliot is having none of that, he was eight years old, and his dad thought he deserved it. Mr. Robot says no, it was Elliot who thought he deserved to fall, Elliot felt guilty for revealing his father's secret. He pleads with Elliot to stop being angry with himself. Elliot says, "You're right. I was angry, at myself. I'm ready to let go". He lets go of Mr. Robot, who falls to the concrete below.
Angela is at her Dad 's home, and Donald comes home. He mentions that Darlene is back in town. Angela asks where.
Gideon is in his office at Allsafe, on the phone to the Dulles data center. They are saying that they have an order to remove server CS30 from the honeypot, and Gideon says it needs to stay on. Allsafe got hacked yesterday, someone unauthorized must have made the request, but Dulles needs to keep CS30 off the real network, or "something's gonna happen". But the Dulles staff says there is an order from Tyrell Wellick to put CS30 back on the network, they have to follow that.
Angela goes to their family's old house, the new family seems to be out, and she finds Darlene there, still searching for Elliot, Angela's old house was a possibility. Then they hear the dad of the new family arriving, and rush out the back door, and down the alley away from the house. They look down, and notice that they are walking through the broken glass. They look up, and see a broken window on the house next door. "Wasn't that Elliot's room?"
Elliot assists Mr. Robot, who is limping and has cuts and bruises on him, as they arrive at a cemetery. Elliot doesn't know why, but that's where Mr. Robot is leading him. Mr. Robot stops and rests against a headstone, when Angela and Darlene appear, running towards them. Mr. Robot tells Elliot, he wanted to tell Elliot earlier, but things got "too accelerated" at the end, but now, he needs Elliot to understand that Mr. Robot will always be right here for him. "They" are going to try to get rid of Mr. Robot again, but they won't succeed, and he needs Elliot to keep them from succeeding. Mr. Robot sits down on a grave.
Angela and Darlene arrive, and Elliot asks them what Mr. Robot was talking about, he's very agitated: "I want to know!" Darlene gently asks, "Elliot, who are you talking to?" Elliot looks down at the grave, and there's nobody there, it's the grave of Edward Alderson, 1949-1995. Also, its now notice that the cuts that Mr. Robot had before, Elliot now has. He's looking dazed and confused. He and the girls also notice that he's bleeding, but he says, "You didn't see him?" He thinks, "This can't be happening. This is happening, isn't it". Now he isn't looking so confused, he's confident as he thinks, "You knew all along, didn't you? You're gonna make me say it, aren't you? I'm Mr. Robot".
Elliot, Angela, and Darlene are at a train stop for the train to New York. Angela assures Elliot he'll be all right, but he says he's very far from all right. The train arrives, and Elliot and Darlene get on board. As they ride, Darlene says, though Elliot doesn't want to talk about, she has to ask if Elliot remembers what "they" were doing, when they first started fsociety .
Gideon Goddard arrives at Tyrell's office, to discover his assistant packing up. She says that Tyrell was let go today. She doesn't really know why, but he was hard to deal with. Gideon asks if he can get in to see Scott Knowles, and she says, "Oh no, definitely not now. You haven't heard?"
It's night, and Angela arrives home, and finds her dad Donald sitting with Terry Colby and some lawyers. As she arrives, Donald excuses himself, and Colby sends his lawyers outside. Angela asks if this is about the case, and it isn't, Colby has lawyers to deal with that. This is about Angela. Colby is impressed with what Angela did, she played a good "short game", and got what she wanted. Angela is relentless and smart, and Colby says he knows someplace someone like that could go places, the people he knows can get her into E-Corp. Angela's surprised, she is suing E-Corp, and Colby will be testifying against them. Colby explains, in business, grudges aren't a thing, the people he knows recognize her true value. She rejects the idea of working there, "They killed my mother ". He says, if she wants to change things, try from within, and let them know by tomorrow. She looks thoughtful.
Darlene and Elliot are at his apartment, he's slouching on the couch while she goes through his meds, lots of empty bottles, he says he fills the prescriptions and dumps the pills. He's bothered about "what's real", but she wants to go get his meds so he can feel better. He's rather run down, not the vibrant figure who thought "I'm Mr. Robot". He suggests maybe they should stop it, the entire plan, the hack, all that stuff. Darlene says hey, it's all ready to run once the infected server gets back on the network. Anyway, it was all really his idea from the start, the reasons and the goal, and they are all worthwhile. She leaves to go get his meds.
Then the apartment door slowly opens.... It's Tyrell Wellick! Elliot jumps up, astonished, but Tyrell comes in, he's not being dominant or aggressive, he's furtive, ready to be spooked. He says he's been waiting outside the apartment until Darlene left, but he wants to talk to Elliot, he knows he's the one behind "all of it", fsociety, the server, Colby, Allsafe, all of it is Elliot's doing. Calmed down now, Tyrell takes off his coat, and says he doesn't know Elliot's grand plan, but Elliot is going to tell him. He sits down and pulls out his latex gloves over his hands, as he says that, two days ago, he strangled a woman to death with just his hands, it was strange, at first uncomfortable, but then she struggled, and he felt absolute power, and that moment has stayed with him. At that he gets up and into Elliot's personal space, and smiles. Elliot just stares at him.
The lights come on at the fsociety hideout, as Tyrell and Elliot walk in. It's now a calm and gentle moment they're having together, no threats or bombast. Tyrell is full of wonder as he wanders among the gaming machines and then the work tables with their computers. He asks what is going on. Elliot explains they are encrypting all of Evil Corp's financial files, and the encryption key will self-delete when it's done, and all the backups too. Tyrell asks who was involved, and Elliot says, "Just me". Tyrell says, "now it's you and me. I've always told you we'd end up working together, Elliot. But still, I have to know: Why did you do it?" Elliot looks around: "I don't know. I wanted to save the world".

EPISODE: S1E10
======================================================================

At a night-time outdoor restaurant, Michael Hensen meets Krista Gordon , they haven't seen each other in a while, and Krista says she doesn't even know Michael's real name. But he called her there saying that he had advanced cancer, to which he actually doesn't, it was just to get her to come. She's upset, but he wants to talk about one of her patients, Elliot Alderson . He hacked Michael and got him in trouble (" eps1.0_hellofriend.mov "), and Michael had the police look into it. He's getting closer, Elliot had taken Michael's dog , and the dog was microchipped, and Elliot had taken the dog to a vet (" eps1.7 wh1ter0se.m4v "), so that proves it was him.
Anyway, Elliot's hack "made" Michael confess things about his private life, which ruined his marriage, and he's now divorced, so now he wants to track down Elliot and get him in trouble too. Michael tried to track him, but Elliot uses proxies and such, something in Estonia, so he's untraceable. So he wants Krista to give him anything she knows about Elliot from his sessions with her. She doesn't want to go there, no matter how upset Michael is. As she walks away, his last words are, "The asshole stole my dog!"
Michael gets back to his apartment, and starts eating takeout to the TV news. He's paying little attention to the stories about panic in the stock markets, the IMF having no leverage about defaults, seventeen countries are near collapse, such as Lithuania, Croatia, many others, ending with Estonia. That gets his attention. The TV goes on to talk about the "faction" responsible for the hack on E-Corp which says it's a chance for worldwide economic reform. Michael stops eating and pays attention, to scenes of mass rallies and rioting in the streets, around the world.
It's morning, and people are lined up to use an ATM, near where Elliot wakes up from a parked car. It's in a parking lot, and the attendant comes over to the car in time for Elliot to get out and ask where he is? The attendant says he's been in this parking lot for two days, that's how much Elliot paid him before the credit card systems went down. Elliot is still stupefied. He notices the car he just got out of and thinks to himself, "This is Tyrell 's. Why were we in there? Seriously, what do you remember? Wait, I don't even trust you". He has no money for the attendant, and he walks away as the attendant says they're going to tow the car tonight.
Angela is walking into the E-Corp building , through its hallways, and into a room filled with people working at computers, there's lots of work going on. She sits at her usual place and gets to work.
At the fsociety hideout, Elliot walks in, and everyone else is there, disassembling the systems, wiping and destroying the disk drives. Many complain that Elliot hasn't been around to do his part, but Darlene says he must have his reasons, and the hack worked, so yay, now we need to clean up and get out. Elliot says just to the viewer: "What did I do? Were you there? Did you see it?" Darlene tries to get his attention, but he's stuck in his own head: "It executed, but how? What happened to Tyrell?" Darlene asks where he went, he disappeared for three days. Now Elliot says out loud, "It went through?" Darlene says, yes, it went like gangbusters, and people are loving it and want to join fsociety.
Elliot sits down a a laptop, and quickly searches for news about the fsociety hack, there are lots of news stories, with titles like "fsociety strikes again, this time, potentially lethal", and "Coordinated attack with China", and "Global system outages". Elliot is mesmerized by the news, as if it's news to him. Darlene sees him transfixed, and asks what is going on, and then asks if Elliot is still seeing Mr. Robot . Elliot thinks, just to us, "No, but I need to". Wordlessly he gets up and starts to leave. Darlene calls after him that they need his help to wipe the systems, but he says, "I told you we shouldn't have done this". Then he leaves.
Gideon and the Allsafe CFO are meeting, and the prospects aren't good, the fixed costs, like rent and utilities, aren't going anywhere, and with the staffing and outstanding loans, the CFO believes that it's time to shut down the company. Gideon argues that they could bounce back, but the CFO says, be real, Allsafe's number one client is in a major crisis, and there's no sign of that ending, so there's no escape. Gideon is hard to convince, but the numbers just aren't there to justify continuing.
Elliot goes to the 23d floor of the E-Corp building, and wanders along the busy hallways, filled with near-frantic office workers and executives, many of them looking at papers and tablets and shaking heads. He thinks, "Why did Tyrell let this happen? He was with me. I told him the whole plan. Shouldn't I be enjoying this?" Televisions in open areas are all set to news, reporting on the catastrophe, lots of images of Obama , Yellen, Merkel, Abe, and other officials, headlines like "Countless cabinet meetings yield no solution". He thinks, "This can be fixed. Forcing their techs to work overtime to try to decrypt our data. I have to find him. I have to know what happened". He gets to a desk area at which he finds Tyrell's assistant . He asks her where Tyrell is, and she says Tyrell doesn't work here anymore.
Elliot hears a television start to play an fsociety video, he rushes over to hear the masked figure announce: "Evil Corp, we have delivered on our promise as expected. The people of the world who have been enslaved by you have been freed. Your financial data has been destroyed". We also see the hackers at fsociety watching the video as it plays. "We at fsociety will smile as we watch you and your dark soul die. That means any money you owe these pigs has been forgiven by us, your friends at fsociety". It then see groups of workers and executives including Angela standing at the televisions, listening, as well as the workers at Allsafe. "We hope, as a new society rises from the ashes, that you will forge a better world". Huge screens on the streets of New York also show the video, watched by crowds, many of whom wear fsociety masks. "And while you do that, remember to repeat these words: We are fsociety. We are finally free. We are finally awake!" The outdoor crowds cheer and wave signs.
Helpers are getting James Plofe , the E-Corp EVP for Tech, ready for a press interview. Angela is his new PA, and he's anxious about her holding his bag that has all of his important papers. Once he has the bag, and the makeup girl is done, the TV director calls out: Four minutes. Plofe gets into place for the interview.
The members of fsociety (except Elliot) file into a room in the animal shelter, a tech there has let them in since the boss is out, and their money is good enough for him. But the room has cages with a dozen dogs and cats, and next to it is the incinerator room, it's the last stop for unwanted animals. He lets them alone. They are loaded down with boxes full of mostly-broken computer equipment. They toss in all of their disks, desktop computer components, keyboards and everything burns. They watch for a while, but then Trenton goes to the other room where the animals are, and starts to pick the locks on the cages. Others join her, and soon all of the animals are free.
Somewhere in town, Elliot knocks on the door of a townhouse, but nobody answers. Joanna Wellick , pushing a stroller, comes up to him, he doesn't know her, but he asks if she knows where Tyrell Wellick is. She says she doesn't know, and wonders who he is, and Elliot just says he and Tyrell "work together", and calls himself Ollie. She asks when Elliot last saw Tyrell, and Elliot says, maybe sometime last week. He's sure that she knows something more than she's saying, and she says Tyrell was acting strange when she last saw him. She says something in Danish to him, and Elliot says he doesn't understand. Anyway, they part ways.
The E-Corp TV interview is running, and James Plofe is explaining to the interviewer how E-Corp has spent all weekend handling the situation, and are near to "getting to the bottom of this". The interviewer asks about how stocks have taken the situation, and whether E-Corp is concerned. Plofe visibly sweats at this, but says they are focusing on the technical issues and on supporting their customers. The interviewer says that an expert they spoke to earlier said that, if fsociety's claims are true, there is no solution, and the data is gone, is it correct to ask the public not to worry?
Plofe nods a little, drinks some water, and asks whether he should be honest. When the interviewer says yes, he says, "You're right. The public should be worried. I mean, personally, my life is over". At this, his handlers start to glance at each other and mutter comments. "My pension, savings, everything has been in this company since I started here, and that's all gone now. I've been with the engineering team all weekend. No one knows how to fix it. This will be impossible to fix". An executive tells Angela to go stop this. She walks towards Plofe, who reaches down into his bag, pulls out a gun, and shoots himself dead, live and on camera.
Police are interviewing employees, and are done talking with Angela. Phillip Price is there, and he says what she went through was traumatic, she should just go home and recover. He turns away from her, but then turns back and asks, she was the one sponsored by Terry Colby , wasn't she? Phillip says he's impressed with how well Angela has fitted in, and wants her to be around this afternoon, if she can be, to come to the press conference, she could pick up some lessons for PR. But she needs new heels, her old ones have Plofe's blood on them.
Elliot returns to Tyrell's car, and searches it, front to back, looking for something, but he doesn't seem to find it. He says to the viewers, "I know this looks bad, but I'm sure there's an explanation. We'll find him. He's gotta be somewhere". His dad , or Mr. Robot, must have left Elliot a clue. He pulls open the sunroof, and a USB drive falls down. Elliot catches it, and yells, "All right, come out! I need to know what happened! Come on out! I'm waiting for you! Come out!" But nothing happens.
At the fsociety hideout, everyone is setting things up for a party, lights and banners. One of them has made flyers, announcing an "End of the World" party there at the Coney Island arcade, tonight. They all take some and go out to put them up. Leslie Romero complains that, they got the job done, the world is changed, and their fearless leader has vanished, again.
Elliot walks into an internet cafe and snack bar, goes to a computer and sticks in the USB drive. It asks for the password, Elliot thinks, "He knows the password, which means I know the password". It has one file, a video of the boardwalk where Elliot and Mr. Robot sat on the railing to talk (" eps1.1_ones-and-zer0es.mpeg "), taken from across the boardwalk. It clearly shows Elliot sitting there, then falling off the railing, and there's nobody else there with him, no Mr. Robot talking, no Mr. Robot pushing Elliot off. Elliot looks at this, slow and fast, forward and backward, over and over again. Elliot thinks, "What's he trying to say? I'm on the hook for everything? He won't come out to play if I ask. So maybe I gotta force his hand. I gotta get myself arrested".
Elliot gets up and asks to use the snack counter's landline, dials 911, and starts saying, "I have a confession to make". At that moment, Mr. Robot is there with him, pushing down the phone switch, and saying, "All right, you got me".
Angela is getting new heels at a store, and the salesman realizes that she was one of the people in the room when Plofe shot himself. He's dismayed, she just saw someone kill himself, and now she's calmly buying heels, he's surprised she could work for E-Corp and the type of people there. She says, some there are bad, and some aren't, but he isn't taking any of that, he says she sounds just like the rest of the E-Corp types. She puts an end to the personal talk, she just wants to buy heels.
Elliot is nearly enraged that Mr. Robot is back with him, yelling at Mr. Robot: "Where's Tyrell?" Elliot grabs Mr. Robot and slams him against the wall, choking him. (We, and the others in the place, can see it how it "really" is: Elliot with his back against the wall, nobody pressing him there, choking himself with just one hand.) Elliot wants to know where Tyrell disappeared to, and Mr. Robot must know. Mr. Robot insists, Elliot knows just as much as Mr. Robot: "You forget, kiddo, I am you". Mr. Robot breaks away and goes to insult someone else in the place, and gets himself punched. It is then see, half-way across the cafe, Elliot falls to the floor. As the others there try to help Elliot, but Mr. Robot stands over him: "I'm only supposed to be your prophet. You're supposed to be my god". Mr. Robot leans down and grabs Elliot off the floor.
Angela arrives at the anteroom to an E-Corp assembly hall, executives are discussing the crisis, and Phillip Price notices her, he's glad that she came. She stares at him for a bit, and he says, come on, you have questions, and he has answers. She asks why is it that Price seems so confident, unlike the others. He says, this problem was made by people, not gods or aliens, but ordinary people. He has the power of the biggest conglomerate in the world, and with that, anything made by people can be overcome. She asks, why was she invited, why is the E-Corp CEO even spending time answering a new-hire's questions? He says that he finds her refreshingly young and bold, exactly what E-Corp needs now.
The executives all move to the assembly hall. On the way, there is a new portrait of James Plofe, and Angela notices it, and Phillip notices her noticing it. She says she can't forget that image from the morning. Price says, he was glad Plofe killed himself, he was not a good person, problems with gambling, drinking, and overall a weak person, with poor instincts. And his family will benefit from this in the long run. They move to the assembly hall, where there are hundreds of people waiting, and Phillip goes to the rostrum, to ask for a moment of silence for their friend, James Plofe.
At the fsociety hideout, it's clogged with partygoers, waving signs, wearing masks, with music and dancing. The "real" fsociety members are off to the side, remarking on how there are now lots of fingerprints everywhere. They're subdued, but Darlene isn't, she wants to party, and congratulate each other for all of their hard work. But Mobley wonders, well, this hack got done, fine, good, but now what? Darlene doesn't care about tomorrow, just to celebrate what they did today, they freed the people.
The night streets are filled with marchers, wearing masks and carrying fsociety signs, chanting "Our streets!" In their midst is Elliot, being helped by Mr. Robot. Elliot says he's sure Mr. Robot killed Tyrell, but that gets Mr. Robot angry and he slams Elliot against a wall. Elliot thinks, "Please, you have to do something. Say something. Make him tell me". Mr. Robot responds: "Stop talking to them! They can't help us. We have to do this together, just us".
Now we see, standing behind Mr. Robot are Elliot's mom and his younger self. They encourage Elliot to believe Mr. Robot and follow him. Elliot complains, this isn't his family, they aren't real, but Mr. Robot says, neither is the one Elliot keeps talking to. He points to the crowd, and says none of this is real either, the whole world is built on fantasy, nobody has been living in a "real" world in decades. Everything is artificial, built that way by corporations for their profit. But, Mr. Robot says, as far as Elliot is concerned, Mr. Robot is very real, and they are together.
Elliot bursts out: "No! I want to be alone. I need to be alone". He closes his eyes, lowers his head and then there's silence. The noisy crowd has vanished and has Mr. Robot, it's midnight on the street in New York and there are no people around. He's alone. Now one of the big screens on the boulevard lights up, showing Mr. Robot, Magda, and Young Elliot. Mr. Robot reminds Elliot, he was miserable being alone, all those lonely nights crying in his apartment. He begged "us" to come, and he needed "us" to come. Young Elliot says, the three of them are deep inside Elliot, they can't leave him and he can't leave them. Elliot is weakened, and asks what to do, and Mr. Robot says, just start listening to "us", the world is a better place from what they did. Now he needs to go get the subway, and go home.
Elliot is making his way through the no-longer-empty streets, past the vendors and crowds, through the subway station. Elliot is trying not to cry, as he gets home. The voice of Mr. Robot tells him, now, to sit at his computer, bring up the news, and enjoy the "beautiful carnage" that they created together. Elliot watches news reports of crowds, marchers, riot police, financial traders, and politicians.
There's a knock at the apartment door. Elliot goes to the door. Black screen. Credits.
Post-credit scene:
A limousine delivers Minister Zhang to a mansion, what looks like a club of the 1% of the 1%; nodding to the hostess and to various frightfully rich men in the club, he sits down by the fire with Phillip Price, who is listening to the harpist. They are clearly quite familiar with each other. Zhang says he knows Phillip has his troubles, but they need to discuss the coltan mines. Price says it's early for that, first he wants to enjoy the music a bit, and besides, there are other items on E-Corp's agenda, the mines can wait. Zhang can see E-Corp's troubles weighing on Price, and asks why, Phillip surely knows the person responsible. Price indeed does, and will handle that person as usual. Zhang recalls, "The infamous Emperor Nero merrily played a lyre as he watched". At that moment, Minister Zhang's watch beeps, the same once-a-minute beep that the Whiterose's watch gave. (" eps1.7_wh1ter0se.m4v "). Zhang pauses, then finishes his sentence: "as he watched Rome burn". The episode ends with a closeup of Minister Zhang.

The episode is preceded by a Previously . . . Segment, covering the synopsis of Season 1 .
It opens in a flashback to the night of May 8th, when Tyrell and Elliot went to the Fun Society Arcade (“ eps1.8_m1rr0r1ng.qt ”) . Tyrell is wearing the fsociety mask where the videos were filmed, only to take it off and asking why they would use a silly mask. He receives a phone call from someone named James. He orders that Gideon 's honeypot be left disabled. Elliot is communicating with the Dark Army on the computer, reorganizing the attack even though they are time sensitive. He quickly deletes the window as Tyrell joins him. The attack is executed. As Tyrell watches the screen, amazed that something has "come alive", Elliot rises from his chair and reaches into the popcorn machine, where a gun was hidden earlier (“ eps1.7_wh1ter0se.m4v ”) .
Glass shatters and the scene cuts to Elliot as a young boy, having just been pushed out of a second story window of his house by his father. His parents rush to him, panicking. Edward is apologizing while Magda blames him, worries about her son and the neighbors. At the hospital, the doctor tells them that Elliot only suffered a mild concussion to his head. Whenever his broken forearm is brought up, Magda asks about the co-pay, reminding her husband that he has lost his job and they have no money. Meanwhile, young Elliot is staring at his brain scan on the wall as his arguing parents are asked to leave the room and the doctor talks to him.
The scene transitions to present day Elliot, waking up in a new bedroom. A month has passed. He dresses and later hear voice over detailing his daily routine. He explains that he is living with his mother, whose house does not have a computer or Internet access. He has breakfast, lunch and dinner at a diner with his new friend Leon , who talks at length about his newly discovered Seinfeld . Leon wonders about the universe and randomness in terms of the show. Elliot's regimen also includes washing dishes, doing laundry, watching basketball at the local park with Leon, and attending a church group twice a week. He has also taken to keeping a journal. Meanwhile, his mother is seen sitting in front of the TV, watching US President Barack Obama accuse Tyrell Wellick of working with fsociety as well as footage of store closings, garbage pileups, and mass protests.
It is revealed that Elliot has been speaking to his therapist Krista in her therapy office. She asks why he has chosen his mother. He says she is the strictest person he knows and the devil you know is better than the devil you don't. When asked if he is lonely, he says Darlene comes by sometimes. She asks if he misses his old life. He says he can't trust himself back there. When he doesn't answer why, Krista reminds him that it took a lot for her to agree to see him again after he admitted to hacking her (“ eps1.6_v1ew-s0urce.flv ”) under the condition that he be more open with her. Elliot says he doesn't trust "him".
As Elliot is walking home, he begins talking to the viewer. He says he cut away from the previous scene and what he told Krista because he doesn't trust you after what you did. In his bedroom, Mr. Robot is waiting. He wants Elliot to get back to work and says "control is an illusion". Elliot journals about what is happening as Mr. Robot becomes increasingly enraged. He pulls a gun, but Elliot first wants to know where Tyrell is. Mr. Robot shoots Elliot in the head, splattering the wall with blood. Elliot rises and journals, writing that he didn't panic like last time.
That night, fsociety militants wearing the mask cut the balls off the Wall Street Bull. On the morning of June 11th, Susan Jacobs is jogging around Greenwich Village. She goes through Washington Square Park, where many tents are set up selling things. Darlene can be seen sitting on the fountain. Susan returns home to a smart house. She is terrorized by the alarm, loud music, cold AC, a hot shower, and a projection of Frank Cody 's TV show lamenting the state of the world and the possible rise of fascism. Susan can't get her house fixed over the phone and is forced to leave for a house in Greenwich, Connecticut. Darlene and fsociety arrive soon after she leaves.
At Elliot's mother Magda's house, Gideon is sitting at the dining table while Magda watches TV in the adjoining living room. Elliot arrives to speak with his former boss. Allsafe has been shut down, although Gideon is hopeful that he can start it back up again. Elliot begins havin a headache, which he imagines as bleeding from the bullet hole from earlier. Gideon explains that he is under investigation by the FBI for 5/9 , despite cooperating with them. His email is being hacked. Mr. Robot is cutting an apple, taunting Elliot that either of them could have ruined Gideon's life. When Gideon asks for help, Elliot denies. Gideon gets upset and threatens to go to the FBI and talk about Elliot and his strange behavior in the days before 5/9. Mr. Robot slits Gideon's throat and Elliot leaves, drawing the attention of his mother.
Elliot journals in his room, repeating the line "I am in control". He bandages his head and continues his daily routine. At the diner, Mr. Robot continues to yell at him, playing off his paranoia about a man at an another booth. Elliot talks to the viewer about what is or isn't a mask. He asks that you have hope for him.
The monologue covers scenes at the smart house. fsociety militants celebrate with the gold balls of the Wall Street Bull with beers and selfies. Darlene is in the top level bathroom, looking sad in her bra. She puts on her top and lipstick before emerging on the balcony and silencing the party with her presence. She demands a guy's phone and breaks it. She reminds them that they are losing the war and explains that Susan Jacobs is General Counsel of E-Corp , able to kill off the wrongful death lawsuits brought against the company.
Later, Darlene orders the militants to make sure they aren't tailed back to the smart house. Mobley joins her. They note that the other founding members are absent and Darlene calls them half-in. Mobley questions her speech, saying it was reminiscent of George W. Bush . Darlene is hurt by that, but claims she needs to rally the troops in losing the war. Mobley wonders if the endgame is protests. Darlene says they need to continue the fight and change the world. She finishes coding on her computer and gives a USB to Mobley, asking him not to be half-in like the others. He asks if she's seen Elliot, but she says he isn't as important.
At the Bank of E-Corp, a woman is complaining to a clerk about her mortgage payments. The clerk apologizing, saying they can't verify payments, not even the paper documents presented as many are being forged. The woman wants to cancel her account, but her money isn't guaranteed to return. The banks computers freeze with a hacked screen as the clerk makes a phone call. We see that Mobley is an IT consultant at the bank and he simply shrugs when the woman on the other end of the phone says he's working on it.
In a top level lounge at E-Corp, CEO Phillip Price and CTO Scott Knowles are annoyed and waiting. Susan Jacobs arrives, apologizing that she came from her place in Greenwich. They acknowledge the hack of the bank. Susan was on the phone with the FBI all night, determining that the same hackers are behind this attack. They demand 5.9 million dollars delivered to a certain time and place. Scott doesn't want to pay, claiming his techs can decrypt the data in five tops. Susan reminds them of the money that was lost in that time as well as the optics of the situation, how they will be perceived. She suggests they pay the ransom with the money they could easily find in their couch cushions.
Phillip addresses the demand that a chief officer deliver the money, which he laughs off. Scott is cautious of dealing with terrorists and Susan suggests sending security undercover. Price doesn't want to risk being caught and having it all go wrong. Scott volunteers for the job.
Intermission.

The episode opens with a USA Network intro from the 1990s introducing Word Up Wednesday. Elliot finds himself in a sitcom, sitting with his mother Magda , his father Edward and his sister Darlene in a car in front of a green screen. Elliot is confused. He hears the laugh track to his mother's sinister one-liners concerning Edward's cancer. He hears a man in the trunk. He looks at Darlene's GameBoy, depicting his assault at the hands of Ray 's men, when his father tells him to keep his eyes up.
A vintage style theme song begins, presenting the real cast names over caught in the act vignettes: Elliot after he was pushed out the window, Edward at the doctor office, Darlene kissing Cisco who has climbed to her bedroom window on a ladder, Angela at her mother 's funeral, and Gideon reading about his own murder in the newspaper.
The car pulls into a gas station of an E-Mart. Elliot is shocked at the world he is in. Magda burns Darlene with a cigarette and knocks her out unconscious. Elliot looks in the trunk to find Tyrell bound and gagged, but Edward quickly shuts the lid and sends his son inside the store.

Edward wants Elliot to get over his mourning even though it's been 12 seconds. The trunk pops open and Tyrell begins hopping away, only to crash into the green screen. As Elliot and Edward stand over him, Edward denies seeing anything. Elliot gets frustrated, even more so as his curses are bleeped. They carry Tyrell back into the trunk. Edward tells Elliot how useful lies can be before he kills Tyrell with a tire iron. Elliot believes Mr. Robot has won and he has been buried into the subconscious. Edward says this is only temporary and shows Elliot a hospital nearby, their destination.

Elliot is silent while Leon gives him an advice: telling him to find his routine, Hot Carla , and to stay away from the Neo Nazis , the group who would later attack Elliot (“ eps2.5_h4ndshake.sme ”) . Elliot asks for a notebook and returns to his cell where he sees his mother . He lets the viewer know that this is all they missed.
Elliot gets his stuff upon his release on August 6, 86 days after his arrest. A guard lets him know he has the Five/Nine Hack to thank, as the prison budget under the economic stress has let go non-violent offenders. He tells Elliot that his credit card is worthless and throws it away upon Elliot's request. He muses on "Init5", the command to return a computer to normal. The world seems gray, as opposed to colorful. Mr. Robot smokes beside him. Darlene is waiting outside the gates with food. She hugs Elliot and whispers in his ear.
Angela retrieves a USB from her closet. Mobley had given it to her before the FBI hack as a means to steal passwords in 15 seconds (“ eps2.4_m4ster_s1ave.aes ”) . She calls Monica , a secretary, during lunch hour and tricks her into coming down to the lobby. Angela uses the distraction to sneak into Joseph Green 's office and use the USB. A coworker mistakes her for Monica and sets up a call. Angela returns to her office and logs into Joseph's account. She copies the Washington Township files onto another USB.
Darlene and Elliot ride the subway. She is telling him about Cisco 's IRC chat with the Dark Army about Stage 2 and the femtocell, as well as Trenton and Mobley being missing. Elliot believes that the Dark Army to be behind his release. Darlene catches the gaze of a man sitting across from them and opts to keep moving. They enter a nursing home where their mother is living. Elliot wants to see her while Darlene chooses to wait in the stairwell, thinking their detour was simply to lose a tail.
Elliot enters the small room and finds his mother staring motionless by the window. He makes note of the broken clock. He thanks her for helping him survive in a difficult time, before leaving.
The Whiterose , dressed as a woman, is at the grave of Lester Moore, the former CEO of E-Corp until he died in 1995: a "crash" rather than an "accident". The Whiterose stresses. She tells her assistant that he was going to shut down her project after the Washington Township scandal before he died. She says she is in the mood to repeat herself. As her watch beeps and her assistant urges that they'll be late, the Whiterose feels like it is important to urinate on his tombstone.
Elliot is peeing in Cisco's bathroom. Privacy is his normalcy. He hears Darlene and Cisco arguing over how she attacked him last time. Cisco was merely protecting her, he asserts. Mr. Robot's voice tells them to calm down. Elliot exits and sees Mr. Robot, who in turn sees him and is surprised. Mr. Robot glitches back and forth between Elliot before Darlene calls her brother back to Earth. Darlene wants to find Trenton and Mobley, but Cisco wants out. Elliot asks to contact his Dark Army contact, Gao Xun . Elliot receives a phone number and gets to work on the computer. Mr. Robot asks what happened, as Elliot simply stopped talking and Mr. Robot is forced to say something.
Zhang and Phillip Price walk with umbrellas in the rain on a large estate. Zhang laments the state of the United States, which Phillip wonders if it may be intentional. Zhang congratulates Phillip on Angela succeeding. Price addresses the failed bailout, due to the shootout in the shootout, which he blames on Zhang. He explains that on Friday, in two days, the federal government will seize E-Corp facilities, including the Washington Township plant. Zhang reminds the CEO what happened to his predecessor, but Phillip reminds him that his death will not save the plant. Only cash will. He proposes that China lend E-Corp the money at little to no interest. Zhang agrees, but upon making a further threat, Phillip says the next step is World War 3 and he would gladly take Zhang down with him. Phillip later leaves.
Elliot hacks Xun's phone and eavesdrops through the microphone. Mr. Robot claims to be overheating. Elliot tells Cisco to set up a meeting so he can ask about Stage 2. When Cisco describes the Dark Army as killers, Elliot says they will be meeting Mr. Robot, which catches Darlene's attention before Elliot affirms that he is going. Mr. Robot voices his concern that something is wrong with them.
At the US Nuclear Regulation Commission, Angela presents the stolen files to an agent, Jeff Gunther . He says this revelation is big, as the radiation levels are still above normal. Jeff suggests Angela to get a lawyer as a whistleblower, but she wants the case to move as fast as possible. He asks her to wait in the office while he shows the files to the deputy director.
Elliot rides the subway alone. The car is empty except for a disabled man playing an electric piano. Elliot tries to go into a another car, but the door is locked. He sees Cisco talking to Mr. Robot and starts yelling and pounding on the door. The subway arrives at their destination and Elliot finds himself in his own body. Cisco asks if Elliot is nervous as they exit.
Darlene is using her computer to translate the audio picked up from Xun's phone. They are talking about a woman. She watches Nancy Grace 's rant against Berenstain as the fsociety video is played on the TV. Darlene realizes something and goes looking through her stuff.
At the library, Cisco and Elliot wait as Xun emerges from the backroom with two devil mask henchmen. Gao Xun is angry at this meeting and tries to leave. Elliot yells for Xun to look at him and tell the Whiterose that he wants to know about Stage 2.
Angela is still at the Nuclear Commission office. Hours have passed. She notices a security camera as the power surges. Deputy Director Phelps comes in and says the surges have been happening all night. As she leads Angela down the hall, she starts poking into Angela's history: her job at E-Corp and if she is New Jersey based. Angela starts seeing more security cameras and realizes she didn't say anything about herself to the people here. She asks for her files back, claiming to need to catch the last train home. Phelps insists on meeting her colleagues down a dim hallway, but Angela leaves.
Elliot and Cisco return to his apartment. The brownouts are happening across the city. Darlene tells Cisco that she left the busted VHS tape with her face on it at the smart house (“ eps2.6_succ3ss0r.p12 ”) . Cisco gets mad, annoyed that they used VHS to be cool instead of filters, and agrees to look for it alone. She thanks him. Elliot and Darlene relax on the couch. She insists that he sleeps on the couch, but Mr. Robot wants to go home. Elliot watches them talk from another chair. Darlene says his apartment is probably bugged. Elliot stands up in his own body and leaves.
Angela is at her apartment when Dominique knocks on the door, bringing Angela's favorite food. Dominique slides her way in and starts eating, complimenting the place. Angela asks if she's working for "them", but Dominique asks who. But Angela wants her to leave. Dom replies with one of her rare dreams; she is with a sexy woman who quickly starts drowning her. She reveals that Ollie told them about the infected mixtape immediately when the FBI interviewed him 2 months ago. They have been tailing her ever since, even her trip to the Nuclear Commission. She tells Angela that the next person who will connect the dots won't bring food but will simply grab her off the street. She says that she is Angela's last hand to play as she leaves her card. Dominique concludes saying that when she stopped struggling in her dream is how she survived.
Cisco is in the smart house. He finds the VHS tape, but notices something over by the couches.
Darlene is monitoring Xun's phone. He is with the Whiterose when the meeting with Elliot comes up. The Whiterose finds it odd, given that Stage 2 is his plan. She asks if Elliot asked about " the man and the girl " before the Whiterose insists on breaking Xun's phone, considering Elliot's skills. As the audio goes dead, someone knocks on the door. Darlene answers.
Elliot is walking home. He believes he has no normalcy. He is shocked the find the SUV of the man he murdered sitting outside his apartment. Joanna rolls down the window, saying "Hello, Ollie". (Elliot had said his name was Ollie when the first met.) (“ eps1.9_zer0-day.avi ”)

======================================================================

In the daytime, Terry Colby gives an advance copy of his book, "The Last Honest Man", to Phillip Price in the CEO's office. Colby can't believe that Donald Trump is running for President and believes he can get on the ticket with all the dirt he has. Phillip says that politics is for puppets. He asks the former CTO to pull a favor with Winston Campbell, who has President Obama 's ear. Phillip wants the US ambassador to abstain in the UN vote to allow China to annex the Congo and he won't forget Colby's help. As Colby rises to leave, he is amazed at how Phillip trades countries like playing cards and asks why. Phillip takes his glasses off and says he has always wanted to be the most powerful person in the room. He has achieved that, except for one or two instances, striving for a God-like legacy.
Joanna Wellick is putting on her dress and earrings. In the SUV, Mr. Sutherland voices his concern of being seen with Elliot. Joanna reminds him that if he had done his job to trace the calls, they wouldn't be in this situation in the first place. She rolls down the window and greets Elliot .
Back at her house, Joanna is staring silently. Elliot wonders why she isn't saying anything, as if she can hear his conversation with the viewer. Mr. Robot feels like she can see him and when he moves to walk away, but she says "You're not going anywhere". Joanna believes that Elliot is working with her husband Tyrell and can find him. Mr. Robot advises against this and Elliot tells her no. Mr. Robot fears for their life. Joanna gleefully tells the story of her first date with Tyrell: how she told him to sleep with a stranger and take her earrings. The next morning, he gifted her the earrings she is currently wearing, her favorite despite how cheap they are. She presents the phone and believes it is another of Tyrell's gifts. She admits they haven't spoken and tells Elliot to trace the calls. Mr. Robot believes she is as crazy as her husband, who killed a woman and was going to kill them. Elliot puts his hood up, but Mr. Sutherland is standing in his way. Joanna takes off his hood and whispers in his ear, asking if he really wants to say no to her.
At the apartment, Darlene is mad that Cisco brought back the man he found at the smart house. He was muttering Darlene's name. She explains that he is Vincent Campbell , a fsociety militant from the D.C. job. Cisco wants to take him to the hospital, but Darlene is weary of a tracking bug on him. Under his shirt is a massive internal bleeding. She muses that he knows her face and name and in the hospital, he will wake up to police and morphine. Their mission is to find both Trenton and Mobley . Cisco yells at her for messing up her priorities. She is not special nor a leader, has been fumbling ever since Five/Nine , and needs to wake up.
Dominique arrives at the smart house, currently being investigated by FBI technicians. She speaks with Agent Yang , who explains that the D.C. militants were found in Maryland two days ago. After a car chase, one escaped while the rest were apprehended. This was the rendezvous. The E-Corp lawyer, Susan Jacobs , who owns the place has gone missing. Dominique asks why she was called. Yang presents a sketch of a man who was seen here, bringing another man into a cab around 10PM. It matches a man from her case. Dom asks why the FBI burned the house instead of setting surveillance.
As Sutherland drives, Elliot looks at the effects of Five/Nine, the garbage pileups, graffiti, and long ATM lines. He wonders if this was the future he was fighting for. Mr. Robot believes that Joanna is crazy and wants to go home. Elliot asks who might be calling. Mr. Robot theorizes that many people hate Tyrell and could be making the calls. Elliot tells Sutherland that if he wants this done tonight, he needs to buy hardware from Micro Center as the police seized all his computers and it could be weeks before he gets them back.
Dominique marches into Ernesto Santiago 's office and presents him with two sketches of Cisco: one described by Ollie and the other from the smart house. Santiago wants to put out a B.O.L.O of the sketch. Dom disagrees, believes that the Dark Army may kill him. They already lost Sunil Markesh , they can't lose this target as well. Santiago says the slow method isn't working, especially for the new direction the FBI is going in after the Berenstain surveillance scandal, and that he's going to the media. He assures her that Agent Thomas is looking into cab companies.
At Micro Center, Elliot gets a laptop and cell phones, astounded that there is an E-Coin discount. He sees Sutherland playing video games when the mystery phone rings. On the other end is breathing and an abrupt hang up. Elliot asks if the viewer heard that and realizes that Mr. Robot has disappeared.
Cisco and Darlene are at the ER waiting room, reading that the Dark Army eavesdrop transcript. Cisco asks what Elliot has to do with Stage 2. He says they could have dropped off Vincent, but Darlene wanted to stay. She admits that she isn't special. She thought she was after Five/Nine succeeded, but Elliot was the one with the plan. She recalls a time when she was 5 and her family went to Coney Island. Her father and brother went on a ride, while see wandered off from her mother . An old woman grabbed her and asked what she wanted from Nathan's. Darlene cherished that, as her parents never asked what she wanted. She felt special. The woman took her home and showed her a pink princess room. Darlene stayed the night, but awoke to police. She wonders about her new life that never was, but thinks that she wouldn't have had Elliot.
Meanwhile, back at his apartment, Elliot makes a super antenna. He receives a text from Angela , in his phone as her childhood hero Claudia Kincaid. Elliot prints out a law enforcement form and impersonates a police officer to trace the call as a suicide threat. Angela texts him 911. Sutherland is split on whether he wants it to be Tyrell. He explains that begins talking about past clients and their strangeness, but Elliot tunes him out. He asks the viewer to look around the apartment, as Mr. Robot kept insisting on coming home. He wonders if he lied about Tyrell.
Frank Cody is on TV at the ER, ranting against society's next step to strip people of computers and information. A nurse is meeting with Darlene and Cisco. She tells them they can see him in an hour.
Elliot traces the phone to an address on 82nd street. Sutherland takes a picture of the address and says it wouldn't be Tyrell at that location.
The FBI break into Cisco's apartment. Dominique finds Cisco's library ID.
The nurse sees Cisco's sketch on the news. Cisco and Darlene's are eating at a restaurant, Lupe's. Elliot receives another text from Angela past midnight. At Lupe's, Darlene says that she has the money stashed away and that they should wipe down the apartment and bolt. Darlene is sick of being paranoid of her surroundings and believes that the Dark Army got both Mobley and Trenton. Cisco wants to think it over. He steals food off of her plate.
The nurse talks to both Santiago and Dominique. As Santiago goes to review the security footage, Dom deduces that both Cisco and Darlene did not see the news and simply went somewhere nearby to wait for an hour.
Elliot meets Angela on an empty subway car. He's sorry he's late. Angela asks why he started fsociety. He says he didn't want to involve her. She says an FBI agent came to her apartment. She wants to confess about the femtocll and is about to go see her lawyer . We can't beat them, she claims. Elliot laments putting his loved ones at risk while he hid in prison. He tells Angela they've come a long way from getting high and watching Back to the Future 2 , which they didn't get around to doing last time.
Dominique asks a person closing a restaurant if she saw both Darlene and Cisco. She then points in the direction where eateries are open. The power surges on the street.
Angela references when she found Elliot at the museum when he went missing. He was screaming at an unseen figure and she asks if that was his father. Elliot doesn't remember. She tells Elliot that he can't work with him and suggests he gets off as they pull to a stop. They stand, hug, and Elliot kisses her. He leaves and Angela is close to tears. As the doors close and the trains pulls away, the Inconspicuous Man and Woman confront her.
Dominique is across the street from Lupe's when she spots Darlene and Cisco. She calls in all units and goes inside to speak with them. Two gunmen like those from China, arrive on a motorcycle. One fires through the window of the restaurant. Dominique wounds him. He stumbles into the street as his comrade drives off and cars arrive, some in pursuit, others stopping. The gunman commits suicide as Dominique runs out, waving her FBI badge. She is in shock, her face splattered with blood.

EPISODE: S3E01
======================================================================

Otto Irving is at a grand opening of a Red Wheelbarrow BBQ restaurant when his order fills up his ten punch hole card. When he tries to redeem it immediately for a free milkshake, the cashier insists that the offer is only valid on his next visit. They argue a little bit over the rules. Irving answers a call on his Bluetooth. He tells the person to calm down and stop screaming. Is he dead? he asks before promising to be there in 15 minutes. He finishes his debate with the cashier by telling her that when we lose our principles, we live by chaos.
Irving leaves and is next seen riding an elevator with the Dark Army member the Hamburger Man up to the floor where Tyrell is pushing on Elliot 's gunshot wound on August 8th. Tyrell is begging for help as Irving calmly checks Elliot's pulse, takes a picture of the wound, and assures Tyrell that the doctors are on their way. He notes that pushing on the wound doesn't help.
Next, Irving puts a business card for his car dealership on the window of a car with many belongings tied to the top as he enters his own convertible car. He is talking with someone about Elliot being in surgery. He is given the name Angela Moss which he writes on his hand and drives away.
A blackout occurs that night, as a scientist gives a walking speech to others about the truth of reality and a parallel universe at the E-Corp Washington Township nuclear power plant. Minister Zhang and an associate Grant walk by. In a room, Zhang looks at Irving's photos and calls Elliot crazy. Grant begins to say "they are both", before Zhang reminds him that practice makes perfect. Grant insists that they (Elliot and Tyrell) are both unstable and asks to be put in charge of Stage 2. Zhang recounts that Elliot's father used to work on his project unknowingly and contributed to its early successes. He notes that it must be a coincidence that Elliot works for them. You don't believe in coincidences, Grant contends, to which Zhang emphasizes that it was Elliot's drive to destroy E-Corp that was the opportunity for their plan, and he has "unadulterated focus". Time presented Elliot to the Dark Army, therefore his will must be their guide. Once he completes his work, then Elliot can die, just like his father . Zhang and Grant are looking out a window at a massive hadron collider which transitions into Elliot's open eye.
Elliot wakes up at night in a bed, believing if he is alive then he must have been right about Tyrell not being real. Angela enters, telling him the power is still out as candles sit on the bedside table. This is her apartment. She tells him that the people he was working with brought him there yesterday after having called and she only recognized Tyrell. Elliot realizes that it all was real. He tries to get up, but Angela stops him. She recounts how she was taken by the Dark Army when Elliot grabs his phone and calls 911. He doesn't say anything after Angela tells him that they will kill her. Elliot leaves the bedroom and wants to stop Tyrell from blowing up a building. Angela says he's been unconscious for 6 days and cautions him. Elliot heads for the door, asking for a shirt to wear.
In a Josh Groban sweater, he goes to the warehouse near the E-Corp tower. Tyrell's workspace has been wiped down and cleared out. Elliot no longer feels Mr. Robot 's presence. He examines the stain on the floor and wonders if the bullet killed his alter ego. A street preacher lashes out at evil as Elliot walks back to his apartment. He notices a car sitting outside with a men looking back at him. His landlord meets him and says he has a visitor. Inside, he finds an angry Darlene . She wants answers, but Elliot turns on a white noise device and warns her about the men outside. She tells him about Cisco 's death by the Dark Army and her questioning by the FBI . She believes she's not safe. Elliot wants to know what she told the FBI and she gets angrier. Darlene confronts him about Stage 2 being his plan and asks him about it. He reveals that the femtocell they implanted on the FBI opened a backdoor in E-Corp's system that allow for a bombing of the building housing in E-Corp's paper recovery system. When confronted about the death toll, Elliot declares that it wasn't him. The internet has been down, but Darlene knows a place where they can stop the attack. Elliot changes into his signature hoodie.
The Aldersons walk to a place where they are let into a gathering of hackers, having a party and playing CTF. Elliot laments that the city is suffering while they are playing games and mutes the crowd as if it were an Apple device. Darlene says they can't get online while the tournament is going on. Elliot decides to win the game himself. Darlene spots Grant watching her. Elliot calms her down and confirms that the Dark Army are after him. Darlene flees into a nearby bathroom. She has a panic attack and cries, calling someone on her phone to tell them that the Dark Army surrounds her and she needs help. The men knocking at the door bring her out. Elliot wins the game and uses the computer to make progress on closing the back door. Before he can finish, the Dark Army men pulls the plug and tells him to get up with Darlene in tow.
Elliot and Darlene are brought outside and told to walk down an alley. They come across a taxi where Irving tells them to get in. They have been followed by an FBI car since the apartment. Irving tells Darlene to open his laptop and log onto a database. Irving has Elliot read the pursuing car's license number, already memorized, and Darlene look up the VIN number. Irving then calls OnStar as a police officer, badge and precinct included, and has them slow down the car's function as if it were stolen. Now alone, Irving takes them to Red Wheelbarrow BBQ.
Elliot wonders if he got the name from them (imagery from his time in "prison") or the other way around. Regardless, he concludes it is a Dark Army front and thinks Irving may have sent him the menu Mr. Robot used to decipher Tyrell's location. Irving tells Darlene to get them all food and to punch his card. Elliot says it's okay as Darlene concedes to sit away from them. Irving reminds Elliot that he should be resting, to which he replies for him to shut the backdoor and is calling the whole operation off. Irving pushes back a little and says their employer will be disappointed, but she believes a plan lives and dies by its creator. Irving wants to go home and work on his book. Elliot wants confirmation from her, to which Irving threatens they can put the bullet back in him as well as threatening Darlene. He leaves. Elliot tells Darlene that Stage 2 is over, to her disbelief. Elliot believes they'd both be dead if it wasn't true. Darlene asks about Tyrell, knowing more than he thinks, but Elliot says he hasn't been involved from the beginning. Elliot believes that the backdoor being shut is the end of it, but Darlene doesn't want to bury her head in the sand. As she moves to leave, Elliot reminds her that they may be the only ones to survive (presuming Trenton and Mobley may be dead). Darlene tells him to go fuck himself and later leaves.
Elliot walks the streets wondering about what Darlene accused him of, switching between thinking too himself and talking out loud. He passes FEMA stations and E-Corp posters while monologuing about the failure of 5/9 . fsociety merch is being sold for E-Coin and is an NBC show. Images of Nazism and American flags flash on screen as he laments that this all started because he wanted to hide from society. Now he's looking into the camera. He fucked society. He fears the future he set into motion. We see the election of Donald Trump , Theresa May , riot squads, and a Muslim registry. Building hour on a prison is tantamount to building a wall. Further images of human atrocities are seen as Elliot says that he is to blame for making society weak enough for evil to take over. He comes across a wall of posters where he sees memorials for Gideon Goddard , Cisco, Shayla Nico , and Leslie Romero . Thunder then strikes.
Elliot finds himself in Red Wheelbarrow as it's closing. He walks out into the rain. At Angela's apartment, he asks for a job at E-Corp. She says she'll try. He asks her to keep an eye on him because she can tell between his personalities, as she knows him better than anyone and he trusts only her. He kisses her. Angela pushes away. He apologizes and she calls their previous kiss a mistake. Elliot thinks about how much it hurts and thinks about how Angela has always loved the people who don't love her. Her power save mode. She tells him about undoing it all: 5/9, what happened to the parents, from the beginning. What would he sacrifice? Elliot thinks it's impossible and when pressed for a possibility, Angela decides to go to bed. She asks him to stay the night. He sleeps on the couch by Qwerty .
An E-Coin commercial is in between real commercials, promising a new currency for a new era.
Angela wakes up suddenly in the middle of the night. She takes a candle out into the living room to find Mr. Robot standing by the window. She takes a closer look at him by the candlelight. Angela wants to get dressed before they go. There's a picture of her and her mom on the bedside table. Mr. Robot asks if she convinced him that Stage 2 is over, she replies it's taken care of. He wants to pick up Darlene to include her, but Angela advises against because she helped Elliot close the backdoor. Mr. Robot gets angry about the backdoor and Elliot's determined existence to stop them. Angela wants to redirect Elliot's energy. She gets a text. She prepares a small bag in case Elliot comes back and reveals that she can tell the difference because Mr. Robot never tries to look away.
Mr. Robot and Angela open a cellar where Irving is waiting. Down in the basement, Irving wonders how she changed Elliot's mind. She blames it on the bullet wound. Irving wonders about the look in Elliot's eye from before, as if they never met. Angela reminds him that she was brought in to manage him. Irving reminds them of "her" punctuality. Angela says she'll get Elliot a job at E-Corp. Irving wonders if Mr. Robot is ready.
The trio enter an another room where Tyrell is sitting on a bed. He walks up to meet Mr. Robot and tries to explain the shooting. Mr. Robot says it's okay, having down what he asked of Tyrell, and makes a joke about. Mr. Robot begins his work on a computer, as Tyrell looks over his shoulder and Angela watches him.
On the bus, Mr. Robot tells Angela he established access into E-Corp's internal network. He asks about Angela's motivations, but she insists they aren't friends and won't talk to him like Elliot. Mr. Robot calls her a liar, but Angela says it isn't lying if she's talking to him. Elliot started all of this and she's helping him finish. Pushing him along is what Mr. Robot does, to which he agrees. Yet he wants to trust her and know her reasoning. Evil Corp killed her mom. She's wanted justice, but they are an untouchable conglomerate. Even Mr. Robot's plan wouldn't win. Not until she meets the Whiterose, who opened her eyes. All the damage could finally be undone. A new world will be reborn. The streetlights turn on outside as the city regains power.

EPISODE: S3E02
======================================================================

Over a period of 5 weeks, Elliot gets a job as a security analyst at E-Corp and works to undo Stage 2 and the fallen state of the world. On his first day, Angela smiles while passing his cubicle with her coworkers. He begins dressing up as preppy with clothes from the Trunk Club, taking Zoloft, and enduring his coworker 's lewd small talk. He thinks that his dorm room philosophy about "Evil Corp" may be wrong, that they may be a necessary evil which must be kept in check, and that he is simply growing up rather than selling out. By joining in the ranks of people who are as 2D as the emojis, he believes he can fix the world that he broke and make it better than it ever was.
Eliot is working on the 5/9 recovery program. He tries to convince the higher ups to digitize the paper records on site locally rather than bringing them to the NY facility in order to avoid a single point of failure. His boss William Braddock is dismissive for a Goo Goo Dolls reunion concert (giving insight to his password: aboynamedg00). Elliot hacks him and turns him in for the FBI for selling private data from E-Phones. Meanwhile, Elliot messes with E-Shipping, buying time by sending the records elsewhere. The next boss up the chain wants to postpone his ambition until next quarter as he late for Soul Cycle. Elliot turns him in for the FBI for hiding pollution records. His meeting with the next higher up likes Elliot powerpoint and wants to bring his pitch to the VP of Technology. Meanwhile, Elliot continues purging E-Corp of its evil members. He feels great creating a better E-Corp once it gets back on his feet.
One day, Elliot looks around the office and admits to the audience that he hasn't fixed everything. The loneliness came back. Elliot weeps in his apartment as Dancing with the Stars plays on his new E-Corp TV. He questions the empty void inside himself not being fulfilled by doing the right thing. In his broken mirror, he sees a distressed emoji.
He goes to Krista 's home where she is holding therapy sessions in the library. She notes that it's his birthday, September 17, which slipped his mind. He has no plans. Krista brings up that they last talked about his sister Darlene . They work through that he hasn't been talking to her because she is a trigger to bring out Mr. Robot . He's been gone. When pressed about how he feels, Elliot says it's different, it's better for everyone. Krista suggests that he misses him and that's okay. He admits missing being a part of something. Something important and meaningful. He stares off in this distance and Krista asks what he's thinking about. Elliot brings up a snowman he and Darlene built as kids. They named him Kevin McAllister after their beloved movie Home Alone . Elliot and Krista are smiling and laughing. Elliot talks about he is going to steal his dad 's camera, but then his dad pushed out window. Krista is shocked. Elliot swears he told her, but she insists not. They were at the hospital late. Kevin melted and Darlene was pissed. Krista asks, What made you think of this? Elliot doesn't know.
On Let's be Frank with Frank Cody at 8 PM, the host Frank Cody interviews Joanna Wellick . Scott Knowles is on charges for murdering his wife , having confessed while beating up Joanna and now a bartender corroborates. Her lawyers have advised her to remain silent, she claims. But she knew her husband Tyrell was innocent and Scott was troubled, targeting them for some time. Frank brings up her filing for divorce, but she says it was a moment of weakness listening to the wrong people. She asserts that she is faithful, the divorce claim is withdrawn, and Tyrell is the only man she ever loved, and ever will love.
Afterwards, Joanna and her son are being driven home in the SUV by Mr. Sutherland . He notices a car following them. After an E-Corp commercial on the radio, news of a new fsociety video breaks. A figure in the fsociety costume gives a warning that something is happening in the coming weeks. Darlene is sitting on a couch in an FBI safe house watching on laptop with Dominique , Ernesto Santiago , and another FBI agent Norm Gill . Darlene assures them it isn't fsociety. Dominique contends that it's from the same Vimeo account. Darlene thinks it must be the Dark Army , given access by Cisco . Santiago gets angry, reminding her that she is a Confidential Human Source with the mission to get intel on Tyrell from Elliot. Darlene says Elliot isn't talking to him, having to asked her brother 5 weeks ago. She invites them to bring Elliot in to ask him. They decline tipping him off as that would violate her immunity. After Darlene vehemently denies any relationship between the two, Dominique plays the prison call from June 16 when Tyrell called Elliot. Darlene is surprised.
Sutherland pulls the car over and approaches the tail which has stopped behind them. He pulls Derek out of the car, who yells about Joanna lying to him for him to testify against Scott, upset that she said she loved Tyrell. Sutherland punches him and tells him to shut up, go marry some girl, and never see Joanna again. As he gets back in the SUV, Derek shoots him. Joanna panics and scrambles for her driver's gun in his waistband. She is shot in the head and falls back. As her child begins to cry, covered in blood, Sutherland shoots Derek in the stomach, leaving him bleeding out on the ground.
Joanna's skull is cut open in autopsy. Dominique and Santiago talk in the room. Dominique notes that the shooter didn't survive and Sutherland is expected to survive with the FBI waiting at the hospital. Santiago says nobody saw them take her body and that her son is going to social services, not the relatives, so as to not tip off Tyrell. Dominique believes what Darlene said about Elliot and the video being the Dark Army. Santiago tells her that she's in charge for Darlene and society gets a text that they have a lead on the video. He is worried Darlene is a flight risk, but Dom says she's good, "Trust me".
At Coney Island. Elliot walks up to Darlene sitting on a bench. She is surprised that he came, given his silent treatment of her. He recalls that she last said to him, go fuck yourself. She asks when did he start remembering everything? Darlene just wanted to say happy birthday. Elliot asks if that's it, to which Darlene asks why he wants to shut her out. He tells her she's a trigger for Mr. Robot. Darlene retorts that what happened to dad fucked her up too and he can't hog their childhood. She wishes dad was here, he'd know what to do. Darlene lets him know that she's leaving, crashing with a friend upstate. Spending the past year with Elliot was not about whatever they did, but spending time with him, just so he knows. He brings up that day they built the snowman. Her mood changes and she asks if he wants to talk about it. Elliot instead invites her to stay with him tonight. It's not on her behalf, as she believes, but he doesn't want to be lonely.
Phillip Price gives a speech at the G20 international summit in Turkey. 19 of 20 countries have signed 5/9 Economic Accord making E-Coin the standard currency to judge all others. Only China has unofficially adopted Bitcoin, weakening economic recovery and declaring currency war. Zhang is watching in the crowd. Later, Zhang meets with Phillip in a backroom, briefly only because it was on the way out. Phillip demands that China signs the accord. In 11 days the UN will let China annex Congo. Other countries may pull out if there is resistance. Zhang reminds Phillip that "your success will always follow mine". Zhang walks towards the door, not wanting to waste time. Phillip suggests that maybe the UN will not vote in China's favor. Zhang turns around and brings up talking to Angela after she stole E-Corp's Washington Township documents. Zhang sees why Phillip likes her as she is a good companion. Zhang wanted to fire bullets into her eyes, but they are so hypnotizing. Zhang insists that Phillip did not mistake generosity for generosity.
As Elliot sleeps, Darlene is fiddling with his computer monitor in the middle of night. She gets her coat and sees the photo of Elliot and their parents at the beach. Elliot is suddenly behind her and asks on what she's doing. She says she's looking for a pen and leaving for a bus. He notes that the transportation strike has stopped the buses. She says she'll take a train. Elliot grabs her and puts her against the wall asking "Why are you here?" Darlene realizes it's Mr. Robot. He yells at her and Darlene pushes him away, leaving while calling him a psycho. Elliot stands there shocked.
The next morning, Elliot goes through his morning routine. At work, he looks around the office. At Krista's house, Elliot tells her he wants her to talk to "him". To see if it will help. She has him relax, close his eyes, and listen to the sound of her voice. Elliot opens eyes and says "You should know that nothing is going to come from this. We were fine without you". Mr. Robot notes their new dynamic of him being unable to come and go as he pleases. "You need to leave him alone, so we can get back to work". he says before hitting on her. "What does he call me?" Mr. Robot, still? As he flips through the books on the shelves he says a quote about a civilization which drives its citizens to revolt does not deserve the prospect of a lasting existence. She correctly attributes it to Freud. Wow. Beautiful and smart. Mr. Robot continues to walk around the room, equating her notion of trying to help Elliot with trying to destroy him. She replies she wants to understand Mr. Robot. He mumbles about being compromised because of "her" (Darlene) and Elliot didn't see it. She asks what he means. He looms over her and says "I'm done talking to you". As he sits back down, Elliot asks if they're going to start.
Sitting on the subway, Elliot wonders if the viewer stayed with Mr. Robot and what he said. Is he working with Tyrell? Is Stage 2 on? Elliot believes he shut down the backdoor as he walks past the hookers and a E-Bank with Chinese writing next to its name. Lenny is waiting outside of his apartment with Flipper . He asks on how Elliot is so lucky, sitting pretty in the state of the world. He admits that sending Elliot to prison wasn't about the dog, as he hates Flipper. The vet bills are through the roof and the dog is shitting everywhere. He shoves Flipper into Elliot's arms to shit over the house "like you did mine".
Inside his apartment, Elliot prepares a bowl of water for Flipper. At 8:46, Elliot sits at his computer for a moment. He insert a USB and turns on Kali Linux, running a Root kit hunter. The monitor is broadcasting to Dominique's screen at the safe house. She congratulates Darlene on a good job. Darlene leaves to sit on the porch.
Zhang sits in a curtained limo with Grant . Zhang orders that Stage 2 will happen on the day of the UN vote whether it goes their way or not. Grant says that it was only supposed to be in case of Phillip's failure. With the Congo, they can finally move their operation to that country's mines. Stage 2 has serious implications. Zhang says "It's time Phillip Price's hand got slapped".
The next day, Dominique is returning to the safe house, located in a trash ridden part of town. Kids on hoverboards ride by and she sees a Comet Electric van across the street. It's 8:01 AM. She's brought coffee for her partner Norm and he notes that E-Coin has driven the dollar down. He says last night the only thing of note from their surveillance was an email with link from Elliot's computer. He jokes there was "some nice intel" in the surveillance, but it is just the song "One Week" by the Bare Naked Ladies. Dominique laments that the song will be stuck in her head all day. They hear a noise outside and see on the security cameras that Elliot is breaking into Darlene's apartment downstairs. Norm says that Darlene is out. Dominique asks about the email which led to nothing, but deduces that the link was to trace it back to them. Dominique watches as Elliot is inside the room below them, taking his hood down and looking around the room.

EPISODE: S3E03
======================================================================

On the night of 5/9 , Tyrell watches the computer screen as the hack is occurring, describing it as something come alive. Elliot retrieves a gun hidden in the popcorn machine and aims it at Tyrell's face. He is pleading when Mr. Robot pulls the trigger and the gun jams. Mr. Robot lets the bullet casing roll under a machine. Tyrell is overjoyed by what he sees is a divine intervention, proof that they have been invited into his circle to become gods. He says that Mr. Robot will need him for their continuing mission to stop E-Corp from recovering, a destiny forged when they first met and he has always felt. Hearing Mr. Robot's distrust, Tyrell puts the gun to his forehead and demands the trigger to be pulled to witness the consequences. Mr. Robot pulls away, saying there is a second stage to the plan. Tyrell hugs Elliot, but is stopped by Mr. Robot before he can say "I love you." He hands Tyrell the gun as he is the perfect kind of a crazy person to "protect me from me."
Outside the arcade, Otto Irving arrives where two Dark Army soldiers are waiting. He looks at the Wellick SUV as they brief him. Tyrell and Elliot arrived shortly after 9PM. Irving reminds the Dark Army soldiers of the drill; he monologues and they hold off on the guns. The Dark Army men put on their masks. Inside, Mr. Robot is explaining the paper records recovery program when Irving enters, identifying Tyrell. Mr. Robot asks who they are. Tyrell glances at the gun on the table, prompting the Dark Army men to pull out theirs. Irving asks Tyrell if anyone saw him there or if he knows about it. Irving demands his keys and phone. Irving gives Mr. Robot an address and tells him to drop off the SUV and go home. As Mr. Robot objects, Irving says if they're seeing him, they must've fucked up. Tyrell's honeypot contact James contacted Gideon Goddard to spill the beans. Irving says Tyrell will be the FBI 's most wanted and offers to keep him out of jail. Mr. Robot urges him to go with them.
They drive to a cabin in the middle of nowhere. Tyrell asks how long he must stay, but Irving isn't sure. Irving says there can be ways arranged to contact his wife, but Tyrell rejects it, wanting to keep them both safe. Irving is leaving, promising to check on him in a couple days, to which Tyrell protests in need of working with Elliot. That's being worked on. Tyrell asks for the gun back. Irving assures him that the 37 acres of surrounding land is guarded by sensors and cameras.
On 5/12, Elliot is arrested for hacking and the theft of Lenny 's dog. The next morning Minister Zhang is being briefed on the case by Grant on a private island estate. Zhang encourages Grant to learn English if he is to become more involved in the operation. Their Dark Army operative in jail will greet Elliot, and an early release is being prepared. Grant says Elliot's guilty plea makes him crazy. Zhang scolds him and wants to know what Elliot stole. A dog named Flipper . Zhang is amused and has his next appointment come in. Frank Cody enters and is patted down as Zhang watches presidential candidate Donald Trump boasting on TV. Zhang says Frank is boarding a plane back to NY in 22 minutes, then gives him the task to keep Tyrell's public image in a positive light and to put fsociety 's origin in Iran. Zhang notes that Frank should back up Trump for president, and when Frank laughs Trump off as a buffoon divorced from reality, Zhang professes that any puppet will dance if the right strings are pulled.
The night of 5/13, Tyrell is awoken by a loud TV and finds two masked Dark Army members watching He-Man . He then finds a man named Mr. Williams in the kitchen making tea. Tyrell wants to know where Elliot is, but Mr. Williams says he's there to explain Elliot's situation. Mr. Williams sniffs a white powder as Tyrell is eager to work on Stage 2 and not squander time. Mr. Williams says he must test Tyrell's loyalty. He asks Tyrell a series of questions. Did you kill Sharon Knowles ? Do you love your wife? Have you slept with anyone else since you've been married? Will you be loyal to me? Were you fired from E-Corp? Are you afraid of becoming your father? Do you hate your father? Mr. Williams demands Tyrell look at him as he continues to sniff white powder and the kettle whistles. He makes "x"s and check marks in a notebook beside the questions. After this intense interview where Tyrell is visibly upset, he breaks down and starts answering honestly. He slept with someone else but did not cheat on his wife. He hates his father and was fired. He admits to being afraid of becoming his father and murdering Sharon Knowles. He says will not be loyal to Mr. Williams as he puts his head on the table. Grant enters as Mr. Williams takes the kettle off the stove. The mustachioed old man shakes his head no, and Grant moves to leave. Tyrell raises his head and pledges loyalty to Elliot instead. Grant looks back and nods his head. Mr. Williams sits back down and says Stage 2 will be planned in the cabin as Tyrell is given a phone and a secure laptop. The operation will be called Red Wheelbarrow at Elliot's request. Tyrell wants to know where he is.
On June 16th, Tyrell receives a call from prison. To Tyrell's relief Elliot is on the other end of the line. Irving is in the other room listening to an audio book as Tyrell freaks out. Irving enters and notes his frustration. Tyrell says Elliot was acting strange. Irving brings Tyrell outside and demonstrates how to chop wood. Tyrell wants to get back to work, but Irving warns him that he may lose his mind up here alone. Tyrell is proficient at using the ax, having done it as a child, although he hated it. Over the next days, Tyrell devises Stage 2 while also watching his son on a baby camera. He continues to chop wood.
On July 3rd, Darlene gives Cisco the femtocell to mod. She complains that he's going to take overnight to bring it back as training Angela is "a bitch." Cisco broaches the idea of getting out of the game and just being a normal couple going on vacations. She teases him and says they must get out of the storm before they start talking about visiting Budapest. Cisco walks away and gets in a car with Gao Xun , driven by Irving. He warns Cisco that Darlene has always been a job and that she is protected, not him. Irving tells him to stop caring about her, trust him. Cisco hands over the backpack and gets out.
At the cabin, Tyrell is coding the femtocell. Irving urges him that it has to go back to the city. Tyrell notices that there is code not for Stage 2, but to hack the FBI's phones. Tyrell says he should be working with Elliot and frustrated, gives the backpack to Irving.
Tyrell continues planning, chopping wood, watching his son, and growing out his beard. He becomes enraged at a gossip headline suggesting Joanna has a man on the side. Tyrell is sharpening his axe when Irving arrives with Swedish Fish to cheer him up. Irving notes Tyrell must've heard about Joanna's divorce and tries to get his mind off it. Tyrell quotes a biblical passage about any man being emasculated by cutting cannot enter the assembly of God. He thanks Irving for the sunglasses he asked for and later whistles a Swedish lullaby.
Angry at the Joanna tabloids, Tyrell packs his laptop and his map and begins walking through the woods with his sunglasses and a hat. As he passes by a small town, a police officer recognizes him and gives chase in his car. Tyrell runs through the woods but is arrested at gunpoint. With him in the back, the officer talks to someone over the phone and plans to arrive at some place in an hour to transfer him to FBI custody. He is excited to get a promotion and wants to take a selfie. At the spot, a dirt road, Tyrell breaks his thumb and slips off the handcuffs. A van pulls up and the officer is shot in the head. The shooter is Ernesto Santiago , who finds Tyrell.
At the cabin, Santiago rants at Irving after having to solve a "math problem" to find the cabin. They were lucky he combed the area and made sure all calls went to him, but he wasn't planning on killing a cop. There's already heat on him at work, having dodged the China shootout and Operation Berenstain blowing up in the FBI's face. Santiago calls Irving's boss, the Whiterose , a maniac and that no one cares about Santiago. As he leaves, he tells Tyrell not to let this happen again. Irving enters and hands Tyrell an ice pack for his thumb. He dismisses Santiago as a snake and sits down. He wonders what the incident was about and notes that he and Tyrell are alike: married to their jobs. Irving recounts that his sons were everything, but his wife left him and took them. He had been lost and after chopping a whole lot of wood, he realized that he needed them. He wants to be a good provider so that he can go home, be greeted by his wife and kids at the door, and watch Big Brother . He tells Tyrell he can be greeted by his family after a long day. Tyrell wants to appear as someone strong and capable to Joanna and by working with Elliot and completing the mission he can achieve that. Irving asks for a few more weeks before he sees him.
Irving arrives at his car dealership and talks to a salesman about losing a sale. He shows him his "#1 Dad" coffee Thermos as something to relate to the customer. The salesman notes that Irving doesn't have kids. Irving gives him the mug just as a prop. At home, Irving has many mugs with different slogans. He watches Big Brother alone and works on his novel, Beach Towel , chuckling at his own work. At prison, Irving meets with Leon, who took joy in killing the Neo-Nazis . He says Elliot got his papers and is about to be released. Leon advises Irving to get Elliot laid to unwind him. At the cabin, Irving tells Tyrell to get packed, as Elliot is being released. Tyrell smiles and gets his stuff, taking one last look at his room.
They arrive at the warehouse outside the E-Corp tower. Tyrell says it's perfect and that Elliot will love it. Irving gives Tyrell the gun back, noting that it was jammed with a squib and the next shot would've blown a hand off, but he took care of it. That night, Irving brings Tyrell to the Fukan Hotel, a Dark Army controlled building. Irving says they reached out to Elliot and are waiting for him to respond. Tyrell will wait in the hotel room, away from the windows, until it's time to meet at the rendezvous and give the taxi the address.
Tyrell demands that he wear his suit to look his best for Elliot, despite Irving's warning that if he is caught in the city, there's nothing they can do. Tyrell shaves off his beard, showers, and puts on his suit. He gets a call and looks out the window to see Elliot getting into a taxi. Tyrell joins him and goes to Chambers and Church. (“ eps2.9_pyth0n_pt1.p7z ”)
Later, Elliot is in surgery in the darkened warehouse floor. Tyrell waits with Angela, telling her about Elliot's reaction, claiming that he wasn't real, as if Elliot were another person. Angela confirms the thought that Elliot can become another person. The bullet is removed and the floor mopped. Angela is by Elliot's bedside as he wakes up. He looks at Tyrell across the room. For a brief moment, Mr. Robot is smirking back at him.

EPISODE: S3E04
======================================================================

On 9/19, Darlene is asleep on the subway when the screeching of the train wakes her up. She realizes that her wallet is missing. Rather than the sleeping frat guy or the old lady knitting, she accuses a young woman standing by the door. She finds out that her energy is suspicious and she demands that she take out Darlene's wallet. After a brief denial, Erica admits to be the theft. Darlene takes only the Polaroid inside, to the confusion of Erica. Darlene lets her keep the wallet, explaining that she stole from her and the other passengers first and that everything since 5/9 has been her fault. She also confesses to killing a woman before getting off at her stop, "This is me."
At the safe house, Dominique returns and glances at the Comet Electric truck parked across the street. Once she enters, the truck leaves and Elliot is there smoking. He goes to the lower apartment, looking through the mail and trash while musing about metadata. Once he sees Darlene's backpack through the window, he picks the lock. Upstairs, the FBI agents watch Elliot on surveillance, realizing he phished them. Norm wonders about bringing him in as Dominique's call fails to reach Darlene because she left her phone in the apartment. Rather than burn the asset and their bridge to Tyrell , Dominique goes outside and covertly tells the returning Darlene about Elliot and to stay cool.
Darlene finds Elliot inside. He brings up that she said she was leaving town. She asks what he's doing there. He sets up a white noise machine to mask their voices and confronts her about hacking his monitor. As he gets closer to her, Darlene demands him to step back so he can't hurt her. Elliot insists that it's him, not Mr. Robot , which she calls complicated. Meanwhile, Norm calls Dominique to come back because he can't pick up their voices on the bugs planted in the apartment. Darlene explains that she hacked him because she believed Mr. Robot was active and Elliot wasn't talking to her. Elliot is hurt that she did that and says he needs to show her something.
At a Red Wheelbarrow BBQ , Otto Irving is eating ribs for breakfast as Angela sits across from him. As he praises the food, Angela notes that coming there was easy, as SDR and cover-stops (making sure she isn't tailed) has become second nature. Irving says this is their Monday morning update meeting, even though Angela says it's Friday. He relays that the Whiterose has set up Stage 2 for Monday 9/29, in 10 days. Angela brings up the shipping delays of the paper records, but Irving says Elliot can speed things up on the inside. Angela asks about the evacuation plan of the building, to which Irving assures her they have it under control. She asks if the Whiterose showed him. After he says yes, she asks him if he believes in her. He points to technology today using the ribs as an example, saying that anything is possible.
The Aldersons stand in Elliot's apartment, which has been tossed. Elliot says he did it to go looking for any other devices. He sits at his laptop and says that Stage 2 was never off. He agrees with Darlene that Tyrell is involved and begins to show her his research before she shuts his computer off. She asks why he didn't just send in an anonymous tip and turn them in like he did to Vera . He walks away and says he wants to see where it all leads. Darlene reminds him that he doesn't blow up buildings or kill people, but he says there's something inside that can't let go. She wants his word that he will fight with her to stop them as they plan their next move, which he gives.
He brings her to Shayla 's old apartment, which is vacant. Darlene will stay there and wait to see if Mr. Robot takes over at night, as Elliot hasn't lost time during the day. Darlene agrees to do it. As Elliot is buzzed to work, he assures his sister that whatever Mr. Robot does is not who he, Elliot, is. Darlene says that she knows.
An Iranian man, Sasan Nouri , sits in an apartment eating cereal while watching Love, Actually . The phone rings, and he looks out of the curtained window. There is a large video camera in the corner of the room. As a SWAT team bursts in, Nouri is already surrendering on his knees, wearing an fsociety mask.
On 9/25, Elliot is in his cubicle looking over the shipping records. He wonders if he had died from the gunshot, if Stage 2 might have died with him. Now Mr. Robot has survived and is planning a terrorist attack, which excites Elliot. He wonders what's wrong with himself. Angela arrives, catching him off guard. He quickly closes the window and poorly lies about it. She reminds him of an office party that night. As she leaves, his coworker Samar makes lewd comments that Elliot should have sex with her.
Dominique and Norm interview Sasan Nouri. Dominique says they tracked the IP of the fsociety video to his home. Norm threatens him with going to prison with Allah-hating Neo-Nazis. Dominique says he's young and shouldn't throw his life away. Norm says they like strong and silent types in Gitmo. Dominique asks if he's working or knows Elliot Alderson, Darlene Alderson, Tyrell Wellick, and gets quick movement of Nouri's eyes only when she mentions the Whiterose. Nonetheless, Nouri claims that his leader is fsociety.
Elliot returns to his apartment, and Darlene meets him at the door. They prepare for their night of surveillance before she elects to join him in walking Flipper . Wondering if she may be killed for following Mr. Robot, she proposes a vengeance pact between them. Elliot agrees. He apologizes for pushing away his sister for weeks. She hugs him, and he eventually returns the hug.
Norm and Dominique talk in the hall outside of the interrogation room. He chastises her from bringing up a legendary bogeyman like the Whiterose, claiming that hacker groups don't have a single leader. They have Nouri dead to rights, but Dominique thinks that it was too easy. Norm notes that the Dark Army is supposed to be trained to commit suicide rather than be caught. Dominque is unconvinced.
At 1:48 am, Darlene is in Shayla's apartment downloading the Sinbad movie Shazam and looking up trips to Budapest. She hears and sees through the peephole that Mr. Robot is leaving. She tracks him through a homeless camp and sees him meeting up with Angela, much to her surprise. She loses them in the subway station and watches them drive off in a taxi.
In the basement where he is staying, Tyrell freaks out looking through the shipping records as Angela tells him what Elliot did. He blames her for letting him work at E-Corp , knowing he couldn't be trusted, and now the timeline of Stage 2 has been changed. Mr. Robot looks through the shipping records on the computer. Tyrell wants to tell the Dark Army, but Angela refuses, fearing the consequences for them all. He suggests reasoning with Elliot, but Mr. Robot denies that as well. Angela insists that they can get planes and trucks to work on the weekend to avoid suspicion. But Tyrell doesn't trust that Elliot himself won't reverse it in the morning. Confronting Mr. Robot, he calls him a liability. Mr. Robot says there is no on/off switch, but to not forget whose plan is it. Tyrell growls that he once thought of Elliot as a god but now considers him a cockroach. He says it's now his project. Mr. Robot chokes him against the wall and asserts that the project is still his. He grows silent and begins to back up as Elliot wakes up. Angela tries to handle it, but Elliot sees her and sees Tyrell on the ground. She sticks him with a syringe and knocks him out.
Dominique arrives at a bar where Darlene is waiting, the former having received a text from the latter concerning a development in the case after a week of Darlene's disappearance with Elliot from the safe house. But first, Darlene wants a drink on the FBI agent's tab. Dominique reminds her that she could get into trouble meeting her alone like this, but Darlene reminds her that the safe house didn't work out so good. Darlene asks about Dominique's personal life, insisting despite Dominique's initial refusal that she herself has lost her friends and family. Dominique is from Teaneck, New Jersey, has two brothers, and has an on/off relationship with someone who isn't the one for her. Darlene notices her avoidance of pronouns, saying she has experimented. Dominique wants to keep things simple by not telling the FBI about her sexuality. She asks about Darlene's relationship, remembering why she avoids social contacts once the death of Cisco is brought up. Dominique turns the subject to something big that FBI intel shows is upcoming. Darlene insists on following up on her lead without a wire, believing that once the FBI can celebrate the capture of Tyrell, she will have lost her brother.
In a basement, Otto Irving denies Tyrell's request for more time, as Stage 2 has to happen Monday 9/29. Tyrell asks about the change, to which Irving replies that the Whiterose is particular about scheduling. Tyrell doesn't believe it can be done now that he lost his partner. Irving encourages him to work past the interpersonal problems between coworkers, hyping him up as a god ready to fulfill his destiny. Tyrell agrees but wants to see his family in person, as the baby monitor has been disconnected. He plans to go to Ukraine with them after the plan is ready to avoid extradition. He also asks Irving to check on his wife and inform her of the plan, as online gossip about her has died down. Irving agrees to see to it. Finally, Tyrell says if Stage 2 is to proceed, he needs the full force of the Dark Army.
It's daytime, and Phillip Price is in a limo on the phone with Angela, who is in her apartment. She asks him to fire Elliot and ban him from all locations of the company. When he asks why, she says her reasons are her own and that she's good to return the favor. He says it will be done. In Angela's living room, Mr. Robot is at the table, confirming who he is and asking what happened. She recounts when Elliot saw her and Tyrell, but he's asking about the call she just made. Angela insists he stay for the weekend. She can handle Elliot when he wakes up while Mr. Robot fights him off. As he voices his concerns about Stage 2 derailing, she receives a text from Irving that it's on Monday.
Darlene packs her backpack in the empty apartment. She looks at the Polaroid and finds that Elliot isn't home, just Flipper. She puts the photo back on the shelf and leaves.

======================================================================
EPISODE: S3E05
======================================================================

On 9/29, Elliot is riding the elevator up in the E-Corp building when a man staring at him says something in German. A screen on the wall is showing news of the UN vote on China's annexation of the Congo. Angela notices Elliot's phone vibrating and she points it out to him. Darlene is on the other end, claiming that she couldn't reach him over the weekend and asks to meet him outside. Elliot hangs up and tells Angela everything is fine when she asks. She invites him to lunch later.
As he walks to his desk, Elliot begins to question if he's alright. He presumes that he has been on autopilot and wonders if this is a runtime error in his routine due to corrupted memory. At his computer, his coworker Samar Swailem remarks on the gathering of protestors outside before recounting another sex story. Elliot demeans him out loud; he meant it for his inner monologue. Samar's confusion and promise of silence turns into anger and then contrition for his behavior. Elliot ignores him. The VP of technology passes by, and Elliot at first thinks he had been rehearsing his proposal all weekend until he remembers that the meeting was last week.
Elliot then discovers that he is locked out of his account and begins to get paranoid. He uses Samar's computer and sees that Stage 2 would've been executed at 6:02 AM had it not been for his patch. Samar sees Bobbi from HR is gathering security, prompting Elliot to ask him to distract them while he gets away. He runs into Janet , who compliments him now on his successful pitch to digitize locally, as she couldn't find him at work last Friday. Elliot wonders about his missing time as he enters a stairwell. Darlene calls and tells him that she had to leave Flipper with the landlord after Elliot disappeared. Before he can ask if she saw Mr. Robot , Elliot becomes trapped between two floors by a man and the security team. After overhearing that the man was just talking about picking up his own son, not Elliot, he gets him to swipe him onto the 44th floor.
Elliot tries to remain calm and slow everything down to look bored and broken like everyone else. He decides that that will only succeed in getting him caught, so he looks for an open space to determine how Stage 2 is to be implemented. Seeing that Monday has left him with no unoccupied computer, he poses as "Henry" from IT and tries to get an older, Wite-Out-sniffing woman off her computer. She proves to be smarter than he anticipated, but points him to Fred , an obnoxious employee Elliot aggressively kicks off his computer. He deduces that the HSMs on the 23rd floor are the target. Seeing more security, Elliot slips into a full conference room. Attracting suspicion from the room, he poses as "Dave Kennedy" and kills time with a manager in a conversation. Once security is down the hall, he makes a run for the elevator and barely escapes their grasp.
Headed for the lobby where they are surely waiting, Elliot imagines what Mr. Robot would say. Mr. Robot tells him to walk away, citing the Vera situation. Elliot determines that he should sneak back in the building and secure the HSMs. First he needs to evacuate the recovery building. In the lobby, security escorts him out.
Outside, the protesters chant that they are what democracy looks like. Elliot calls in a bomb threat to the building. Darlene meets him and as he begins to tell her his plan, she reveals that she has been working with the FBI . As she explains about the whiteboard and what they've known for months, Elliot can't get over her secrecy. She explains that all they want is Tyrell , who they think is the mastermind. Elliot brings up the hacking situation and accuses her of wearing a wire. As Darlene explains that she saw Mr. Robot with Angela, he remembers seeing Tyrell, concluding that Angela and Darlene have betrayed him.
At 9:16 AM, CNN reporters ( Annika Pergament and Laurie Segall ) outside the demonstration cite multiple reasons for the protesters. Someone throws a beer bottle at the riot squad and a wave of people rush into the building amid smoke screens. Masked rioters destroy and spray paint the lobby as a group commandeer an elevator. The UN is still deliberating. The group continue its path of destruction on the 41st floor, where Angela watches in the safety of her office. She calls Irving , who tells her that there is a package for her at the secretary's desk. She retrieves it and learns that she must find Elliot amid the Dark Army distraction and have him make a backup of the HSM keys. Angela gets in the elevator and rejects a call from Elliot. A security guard joins her and agrees to take her to a safe room on the 23rd floor. A blackout and restarting of the elevator makes Angela drop the package, revealing an ID with Elliot's picture on it and higher security clearance than she has. The guard becomes suspicious and insists she comes with him.
On floor 23, the guard is attacked after Angela draws the attention of rioters. They chase her as she swipes into her destination. With gloves on, she follows the instructions for what to do with the HSMs, kept a room adjoining an office. Angela is looking for a spare USB key in the office when a woman enters. They talk a little bit and notice each other's IDs. The woman notices Angela is wearing gloves and gets suspicious. A rioter breaks into the room but is maced by the woman, who runs away. Angela completes the job and finds the rioter gone. She puts on a hoodie she finds hanging and a discarded and bloodied mask to traverse the hallways. Rioters loot the unconscious security guard and pay her no mind. On the elevator, she takes off the mask and sees Frank Cody on TV reacting to the news of China's success, supporting Donald Trump in the arms race of global superpowers. She calls Irving and tells him about the woman who saw her doing the job, explaining that she couldn't find Elliot in the riot as she was almost attacked. Irving explains that not all the rioters are their men. Angela gives him the name of the woman, Lydia Reilly , and asks about the evacuation. He assures her that they took care of it, that the Whiterose can make it all better, and to remember the cause. Back on floor 41, she meets the Hamburger Man and they exchange packages. Angela becomes emotional as she walks back to her office. She runs into Elliot, who asks if there's anything she wants to tell him.

EPISODE: S3E06
======================================================================

Circa 1994, Angela is watching Back to the Future: The Animated Series on TV, as the living room behind her is full of people. It is a party for her mother, with a cake that reads: "See You in Another Life." Edward Alderson sits on the ground beside her, saying that Elliot has the show on VHS. Angela asks about his whereabouts and agrees that she doesn't want to be there either. Edward says if he were in her mother's position, he'd want Elliot and Darlene to come talk to him, likening it to Back to the Future , where giving someone a little push to do something can save the future. He also tells her to give Elliot a little push should the need ever arise.
In another room, Emily Moss is talking with her husband and lawyer. Antara brings up Emily's anonymous donor, causing Donald Moss to abruptly leave. Emily insists on stopping the treatments and spending her remaining time with her friends and family. After Antara steps away, Emily notices her daughter watching nearby and calls her over. Angela thinks the party is weird and addresses that her mom is dying. Emily tells her that it won't be a goodbye. She will always be there for her and that there is another world where they will meet again to dance, play, etc. Emily asks that Angela believe in her.
Back at the E-Corp office on 9/29, Angela plays dumb when confronted by Elliot. He says he saw her on Floor 23. She wants to let today happen. He asks if she's working with Tyrell and accuses her of manipulating him. Rioters force them to go into her graffitied office. She assures him that his revolution will succeed. Elliot says he sounds like "him" ( Mr. Robot ). Angela reminds him that Mr. Robot is him. Elliot wants to stop Stage 2, but Angela believes that the Whiterose will change everything. Elliot calls the Whiterose a terrorist and a liar. He emphasizes that people are going to die, but Angela believes that they will be fine, including their parents. Elliot presses her against the wall and demands the package she took from Floor 23. After learning that she handed it off, he wants to know what she knows. She gets out of his grasp and tells him that he has been banned from the building. Elliot sees the Red Wheelbarrow bag she was holding and remembers when Tyrell told him a similar poem.
In the FBI safe house, Norm and Dominique both confront Darlene about her meeting with Elliot. Norm and Darlene don't like each other. Elliot calls and tells her that he texted her Tyrell's address. He wants the FBI to stop him. Dominique wants to bring Elliot in, but he rushes the conversation. Darlene apologizes for what she did to him before he hangs up. Norm is unable to trace the call, but determines the address is a Red Wheelbarrow restaurant. Dominique at first ignores Norm's urging to go there as she stares at Darlene and asks what she isn't telling her. Darlene says nothing, and Dominique leaves with Norm.
Elliot is walking down the sidewalk, determining that if he can't gain access in the E-Corp building because of the rioters and the police, then he'll have to do it within the Recovery building.
Dominique and Norm are in Ernesto Santiago 's office vouching for the address. Santiago asks if the source had eyes on Tyrell. No, but Norm says it's credible regardless. After a moment's thought, Santiago decides to put surveillance on the location for confirmation, as Darlene hasn't given them anything so far and disappeared for almost a week. He doesn't want to break down doors on their only shot, saying that Tyrell isn't going anywhere. Dominique storms out, followed by Norm. Santiago texts Irving that the location is burned and Tyrell needs to be taken care of. He watches the news, seeing that as of 10:35 AM, the UN has allowed China to annex the Congo.
At a convention hall in the Mar-a-Lago Club, Phillip Price joins Minister Zhang at the bar for a drink, bearing congratulations for the UN vote after their tit-for-tat. Zhang didn't expect Phillip to make the party, given the events going on at E-Corp. Phillip says that he wouldn't miss the soiree, dismissing his "dear, little wounded E-Corp," as he expects China to sign the economic accord supporting E-Coin. Zhang says that all of it is being done by end of day as they toast as winners, setting their brinkmanship aside. They stand around awkwardly before making fun of the venue and the buffoon of an owner before Phillip abruptly leaves. Zhang receives a call from Grant about Tyrell being compromised, with a brief response that it changes nothing and that Grant knows what to do.
Elliot arrives at the Recovery building, thinking about killing a process and stopping Stage 2. The NYPD and FDNY have labeled the bomb threat a false alarm and are letting people back in. Elliot tries to convince a fireman that it isn't safe but is dismissed, as no tangible threat was found. Elliot gets in line and steals a badge from a security guard, allowing him in. He rides the elevator up and finds an empty room where he can set up his laptop. Online, he sees that Angela has helped override his patch with the cloned HSM key. Before he can buy time, he finger freezes over the ENTER key. He finds himself wearing the Mr. Robot jacket and then starts glitches out.
Elliot is confused, as he is suddenly in a taxi where the driver is talking. Elliot sees that it is 11:57 AM and realizes that Mr. Robot stole 15 minutes. He hits his head getting out and runs to the nearby Recovery building, believing that the bomb is being prepared and could go off at any minute.
At the FBI office, Dominique receives a call from a worried Darlene. Dominique makes Darlene mad by threatening to hang up and says she hopes the secret is worth it. Darlene leaves the safe house, using a curse word when dismissing girl scouts at her door. Dominique is staring at the Red Wheelbarrow BBQ location on the monitor when she asks Norm to go out to lunch.
In Tyrell's basement, the Dark Army are cleaning the place out. Tyrell asks Irving about his family but receives no answer.

Tyrell reads the letter.
Dominique gets her food and takes a seat.
Santiago calls his mom, tells her to stay home the rest of the day, and promises to get her Ensure delivered that day. He also tells her he loves her too and gazes at a New York City snow globe.
Tyrell burns the letter as Dominique begins to snoop around the back of the restaurant. He pours vodka on the fire in a bucket.
Angela is on the subway, sitting across from two elderly women having a conversation. Nearby, a nervous man in an fsociety mask robs the elderly women. He points the gun at Angela and demands her purse too.
Dominique notices smoke coming from the kitchen behind a locked door, while Tyrell drinks the vodka. Norm tells her there is no backroom. Dominique calls in the fire to the FBI as Tyrell locks handcuffs on the bed frame. Angela has a face off with the robber as the elderly women urge her to give up her purse. Dominique draws her gun. The robber runs away when the train stops, without Angela's purse. The old women tell her she could have died, but she tells them no one is going to die.
Dominique kicks open the door and goes down stairs. She finds the bucket and a bed with an empty set of handcuffs attached. She looks around the darkened room with her flashlight and finds a secret tunnel.
Elliot also goes down a stairwell, thinking about how he can stop Stage 2, when he glitches out and trips. He continues to glitch but gets to his feet. In the basement, he runs down the hall before running into the wall. His body slams itself on the ground and his head against a pipe. He muses that the dual kill commands of both he and Mr. Robot are working toward a stalemate, but Elliot perseveres. A man passes by and watches as he continues down the hall and appears to abuse himself.
In the Red Wheelbarrow basement, the FBI are on the scene as Santiago lectures Dominique. She counters that there was a fire, and she did the right thing. He counts it as a win, that they are closer to Tyrell with a search party in the tunnel.

Elliot wonders about the Whiterose's plan to blow up an empty building. He sees people on the streets all looking at their phones and gets curious. At a wall of TVs in a store, he finds a gathering of people. The news is showing that the 71 E-Corp records facilities exploded: "America Under Attack." Elliot realizes that he was so set on protecting the NY building, he became the single point of failure. The news reports that the death toll is expected to be in the thousands.

======================================================================
EPISODE: S3E07
======================================================================

In a house, a man lies dead on the floor as the TV news covers the 71 E-Corp buildings that have exploded. On the couch, Leon sits between a trembling Sunil and Shama . He denounces the award-winning show Frasier while praising Knight Rider for its believable protagonist. Sunil pleads for their lives, offering their usefulness. Leon says that Sunil's roommate was just an example. Shama asks why Leon is there. Babysitting, he says, before praising Knight Rider again for foretelling society's dependence on technology. Leon drives away from the suburbs with Sunil and Shama in the backseat and goes off-road into the Arizona desert.
Elliot is watching the news of the attacks at a storefront's wall of TVs and begins to cry. He hears sirens go by, puts his hood up, and runs away. At Krista 's home office, she tries to calm him down. But he can't say what's bothering him and begins to glitch away. Mr. Robot takes his place and speaks to Krista instead. He laments that Elliot ran to her, using a middle man to converse. Krista asks about what Elliot was trying to say before glitching away. Mr. Robot explains that everything that happened today was because he wouldn't listen to him and that the real string-pullers are still out there. He explains that their mission was to give control back to the people when his ideas were hijacked. Krista thinks that he supported 5/9 , but he clarifies that he was the architect. She wants to get at his and Elliot's problems, but Mr. Robot wants to leave before they can blame the attacks on him. She questions him, as he explains that the plan was for only one of the buildings. Krista thinks he has delusions of grandeur because Tyrell is said to be responsible on the news. Mr. Robot dismisses it as media lies and refuses to be treated like a psychotic patient. He gets in her face and spells it out that Elliot worked at Allsafe during 5/9, was arrested for hacking, hacked her, and is crazy.
An fsociety video takes responsibility for the attacks and promises something else in 24 hours. Dominique and Ernesto Santiago are playing the video for a visitor in an FBI room. The man, Tyrell's lawyer , tries to leverage Tyrell's warning as the heroic efforts against the foolish FBI: that he had been kidnapped and threatened into working with terrorists. Santiago counters with Tyrell's order to disable the honeypot on the targeted server on the night of 5/9, while being investigated for murder. The lawyer notes that Tyrell was cleared of murder charges. Dominique points out that Tyrell was fired two days before 5/9 and now has resurfaced the day of the explosions. The lawyer calls it a coincidence with no hard evidence. He says that Tyrell can ID the true terrorists in exchange for immunity, using the 24-hour threat to his advantage.
In Santiago's office, Dominique wants to bring in both Darlene and Angela , questioning everybody to get after the Dark Army . Santiago wants to confer with the FBI director and POTUS with concrete evidence. They continue to yell as Dominique says something isn't adding up, since he wants to wait when the clock is ticking toward another attack. Santiago asks what that's supposed to mean and tells her she isn't a super cop and that she reports to him.
Darlene and Angela watch the news in Angela's apartment. Angela coldly notes that the death toll is estimated at 4,000 and climbing. Darlene takes the remote away from her and tells her to chill out. Angela wonders if the dead are going to be okay. Darlene says that she's going to go get her stuff and will come back.
Tyrell is in an interrogation room, asking to see both his wife and child. An FBI agent, Stanchek , has him look through a book of faces, one of which is Elliot's. Santiago talks to his mom on the phone, telling her that she shouldn't be afraid to leave the house, as she has two treatments left and the FBI caught the guy behind the attacks. The threat is only a scare tactic. He promises to call the doctor to reschedule and tells her that he loves her too. He looks at the news and throws his phone. Stanchek comes in and says that Tyrell identified two suspects corroborated by Sasan Nouri . Santiago snaps at the agent before being told about Tyrell's request to see his family.
Santiago goes to see Tyrell and turns off the camera. He assures him that they are alone and can speak freely. Tyrell is silent, nothing to get off of his chest when prompted. Santiago tells him that his wife died almost two weeks ago. A lover 's quarrel, and he shot her in the head. Tyrell at first thinks he's lying. Santiago tells him his son is in a foster care with a pretty low abuse rate, one in five. He promises Tyrell that he won't live and his son will be forgotten if he tells anyone about Santiago. Tyrell weeps and Santiago turns the camera back on before leaving.
Leon turns off the road and eventually stops the car in the desert. He opens the trunk and begins digging. Sunil blames Shama for sending the email to the FBI, believing that's how the Dark Army found out. She says she didn't send it, but it will go out automatically to someone she trusts. Sunil whines about his missed J-Date with Juanita Rosenberg , wondering if she called the cops. Shama is trying to get out of her restraints, wanting to be with her family: Her brother is probably freaking out. Sunil continues to rant as Shama frees herself. Although she doesn't know how to drive, having grown up in New York City, Sunil convinces her to try. Leon watches them crash nearby.
In her office, Krista talks to her friend and lawyer Chad Davidovitz about how she almost reported Elliot to the authorities. He reminds her of the doctor-patient privilege. She says she believes Elliot is responsible. He tells her a lot of crazies are claiming responsibility.
Angela watches an apartment building collapse on TV and rewinds it repeatedly. Darlene comes in and finds her on the floor talking about the death toll not mattering, even if there's more. Darlene asks her about more attacks, but Angela says she doesn't know. Angela takes Darlene's hand and has her sit beside her. She shows her that all the people came back, showing her again by rewinding the video. Angela repeats that everyone will be okay.
Mr. Robot arrives at Otto Irving 's car dealership. Inside, the front desk is empty. Mr. Robot finds Irving working on a car in the garage with his back turned. Mr. Robot begins yelling about Stage 2 being his operation when the masked Dark Army soldiers knock him unconscious.
At Mar-a-Lago, Zhang is telling a man that global conflict creates profit when Phillip Price walks over to him just to say it's all bullshit. The man leaves as the two talk about Phillip being marooned there even with everything going on. Zhang notes that China signed the economic accord. Phillip blames Zhang for the attacks, but Zhang suggests that American sympathy will only help E-Corp. It's too big to fail. Phillip sits and addresses the notion that Zhang surprised him with 5/9 in order to create the economic pressure that would allow manipulation for the UN vote. All of it went to plan, but he can't find upside in the attacks "coming after me." Zhang reminds him of when they sat together on 5/9 listening to a woman play the lyre. Phillip swore he would handle the lawsuit against the Washington Township plant, yet his pet project Angela was allowed to keep the lawsuit. Since he couldn't manipulate and control her, Zhang had to. Zhang reminds him that he was installed as CEO by Zhang only to protect the plant, and his predecessor died for failure. Phillip is to find his own replacement and facilitate the plant's relocation to the Congo. Phillip laughs it off before loudly demanding the real reason all that destruction was necessary, drawing the room's attention. Zhang calls it a lesson, because Zhang has to ask Phillip twice. Zhang walks away.
Shama continues digging the grave, musing that they may be recruited for another attack, as the hole is big enough only for one. Sunil's roommate's dead body lies on the ground nearby. Leon, sitting on the hood, says that he can hear them. Sunil asks about what the Dark Army wants and threatens that they'll stop digging. Leon threatens them with his knife, and where it's been. Sunil takes his turn digging.
Mr. Robot is sleeping in a car when Irving knocks on the window. Mr. Robot isn't wearing his glasses or hat as he emerges. Irving points out a fancy rooftop party, noting how the partygoers can be so joyous on the day of America's worst terror attack. Mr. Robot asks who gave the orders, asking about Tyrell. Irving tells him that the plan was bought and paid for by the people like those at the party. Mr. Robot calls him out for going into the building, to which Irving says he's just there to clean up the situation a senator's mistress on the payroll who overdosed. No death—thousands by terrorism or a body in the guest room—stops these parties.
Leon brings in both Shama and Sunil back to the house, which the Dark Army is clearing out. He says he's leaving them with the Dark Army, and he hopes that Grant treats them well. Grant asks that they follow him into the garage. Elsewhere, two Spanish-speaking workers, Pedro and Hector , are eating when the news shows both Sunil and Shama as having been identified by Tyrell. Hector recognizes them as Frederick and Tanya from work. Pedro says that he should report them. In the garage, Grant has Shama and Sunil sit at two desks.
Dominique, Santiago, Norm , and others remotely watch a raid on the Arizona house. Sunil and Shama identify what's on the computers as malware targeting air traffic control across major cities. Shama notes that the code is already written. The SWAT team move in closer. Grant has the soldiers place their guns on the desks. SWAT is in the house. Grant speaks about the Dark Army's willingness to die for their cause. Sunil pleads for their lives. Grant says the Dark Army believes in honoring something larger than themselves through suicide, sacrificing everything. Shama and Sunil offer their services. Grant says everything in the room is just to tell a story. The Dark Army soldiers force a gun to Sunil's head.
SWAT enters the garage to find the blood-stained computers and Shama and Sunil dead from apparent suicide. The control center is shown an Iranian flag on a wall and fsociety paraphernalia in the garage. Santiago tells Dominique that it's over, and though they didn't get them alive, they stopped another attack. Dominique enters the whiteboard evidence room. She crosses out both Shama and Sunil and puts "? Whiterose" at the center of the web, sighing "You're actually gonna get away with this."

======================================================================
EPISODE: S3E08
======================================================================

In the Washington Township movie theater, February 1995, Edward Alderson tries to get the coughs out of his system as he urges a solemn young Elliot to mix M&Ms into their bucket of popcorn. With his arm in a sling, young Elliot voices his annoyance at being there, to which his father suggests they go see another movie and apologizes once again. Young Elliot calls him out for being sick but not wanting to admit it. Edward admits his mistake and wishes to be a better father to him. When asked if Elliot could forgive him, young Elliot says no. Edward considers leaving before he starts coughing again, then collapses onto the floor. Young Elliot puts on his father's Mr. Robot jacket and goes into a theater as a crowd forms. He takes a seat and shushes someone we can't see as the movie begins.
Elliot walks into his bathroom and looks at his broken bathroom mirror. It has been three weeks since the attacks, October 21. He reads a Vox article online about evidence linking fsociety to Iran. Shama and Sunil are being blamed, connected to the arcade , Red Wheelbarrow BBQ , and the Phoenix house. Elliot muses about deletion, clearing unwanted data for space, as he burns his files on both Shama and Sunil onto CDs. He looks at Sunil's brother Sandesh 's Facebook page and sees his information before deleting the records from his computer. He breaks down the hardware and is microwaving the chips when Darlene knocks. She questions his "routine" wipe down before urging him to speak to Angela , who is having a mental breakdown. Elliot says he doesn't care. When Darlene brings up that Angela was there for him during his troubles, Elliot calls himself an asshole. Darlene is worried that he hasn't left his apartment since the attacks and assures him that he wasn't responsible. Elliot says it was him if it was Mr. Robot. He goes on to rant that E-Corp will be fine with E-Coin while Mr. Robot is doing dandy. Neither medication, therapy, nor prison can get rid of him, so he must still remain because Elliot likes it. Darlene is scared for him. Elliot sits beside her and asks for more time to cope. Darlene accuses him of giving up and wants to stay with him. Elliot wants to be alone. But he offers to smoke up with her the next day and watch The Careful Massacre of the Bourgeoisie . Darlene notes it isn't Halloween, and Elliot asks since when do they follow the rules. She leans her head on his shoulder: "I’d like to." He puts his arm around her: "Me too."
Elliot leaves Flipper with his landlord for the day. He looks at the dog and thinks about the hesitation of deletion. Elliot takes the Mr. Robot jacket from his closet and thinks about deleting himself and Mr. Robot from the world (as well as from the viewer). He leaves the jacket at a trash-burning business. In a bedroom, Elliot wants to buy morphine from a drug dealer named Hard Andy . When Elliot asks for the whole bag, Andy wants to know how they know each other. Elliot says a referral. Andy wants Elliot to take both his shirt and pants off, even though he already did a pat down. Andy wonders if Elliot is with the police, looking to resell in the neighborhood, or finds his life unbearable. He comes on to Elliot a bit and surmises that Elliot has a death wish as well as calling him a cute boy.
Elliot knocks on the door of Sunil's brother Sandesh's house. Sandesh tells him to get lost, but Elliot insists on paying respects some place. Sandesh then starts grousing that Sunil has endangered Sandesh's job. Elliot tells him not to believe what's being said o the news. But Sandesh believes the news and refuses to pay for a "terrorist's" funeral, slamming the door.
A billboard memorializes the 71 attacks. A military vehicle roams around the streets reminding the city of curfew, 9 PM to 4 AM. Elliot arrives at Shama's house as her father is packing the car, preparing to move. Arash says he doesn't want trouble as he sends his family inside. Elliot says he went to school with Shama and that she was a good person, insisting she is innocent. Arash asks if he knows why she went to Arizona. Elliot says no. Arash stops his son from eavesdropping and believes her to be a victim of Islamophobia. As Elliot walks away, Arash thanks him for saying nice things about his daughter.
Elliot takes the subway to Coney Island and sits on the beach alone. As he opens his bag of morphine pills, Shama's brother Mohammed appears and asks about it. Mohammed dismisses the idea of needing a babysitter but doesn't know how to get home because he followed Elliot. He sits down, much to Elliot's annoyance. Mohammed asks about why Elliot said Shama was innocent, getting no answer. Elliot ultimately decides to walk the boy home.
Mohammed talks about the mosque that he and Shama went to, telling an anecdote about her tripping putting her shoes back on. They pass a basketball court turned military detention center. Elliot insists that he needs to get back to Coney Island for something important. Mohammed keeps asking questions. At the house, no one answers the door. Mohammed asks more questions, and finally Elliot says he used to like movies. Mohammed has never been to the movies and wants to go. His parents went to go visit his uncle in Connecticut. Elliot asks Mohammed if he's lying but promises to take him to see a movie if something good is playing.
It's Back to the Future day at the theater. Mohammed doesn't know what it is and wants to see The Martian . Elliot says The Martian looks like shit and is surprised that his childhood dream to see Back To The Future Part II on the day Marty goes to the future (Oct. 21, 2015) has presented itself. Elliot puts M&Ms in the popcorn to the initial dismay of the boy, who after tasting it, admits to liking it. In line, Elliot tries to explain the movie to Mohammed, starting a debate among costumed fans about the intricacies of time travel. Elliot dismisses The Martian 's 92% on Rotten Tomatoes as most critics having shitty taste.
During the movie, a person cosplaying as Doc asks Elliot to hold his flux capacitor prop as he cleans his glasses. Afterward, Elliot discovers that Mohammed has disappeared. Out by the concessions, Elliot learns from a worker that the boy left. Elliot notices two people leaving, one of them complaining about her heels. It reminds him of Mohammed's mosque story about Shama tripping while putting on her shoes. A Jewish man named Sy stops his ice cream truck and gives Elliot a ride to the mosque. Elliot notes that the driver is listening to War of the Worlds . He finds it ironic. The driver explains that it actually is about the persevering of humans in the end.
Elliot finds Mohammed alone in the mosque. He questions why he bailed and said he would've brought him here. Mohammed brings up that Elliot said that he had something important to do. Elliot wants to bring the boy home. He is urgent. Their argument ends abruptly when Elliot blurts that he also wishes he were dead. Mohammed sometimes thinks he did something bad to make his sister Shama leave. Elliot consoles him and takes the blame himself. Mohammed tells Elliot to take his shoes off inside. He does and vows not to trip on anything when he puts them back on. Mohammed says that he could be president because he was born in the US, unlike the rest of his family. He says if he were president, he would stay in his own house, bring back his sister, put the real bad guys in jail, make everyone have Pop-Tarts for dinner, and make everyone to be nice to him. Elliot calls him a dictator, defining it as a really bad president. They discuss Elliot's birthplace in NJ. Mohammed reveals he was born in Trenton.
The duo returns to the Biswas house to find that his parents still haven't returned home. Mohammed opens the door with his key. He thanks Elliot for taking him to the movies and asks his name. He apologizes for making him late for his important thing. Mohammed asks to see Elliot again, who promises to take him to The Martian before his family moves. Mohammed tells him to wait while he gets something for Elliot. Elliot begins to cry while waiting. Mohammed gives him a green lollipop because Elliot said he was sick.
Elliot returns to Sandesh's house and tells him to give Sunil a proper funeral. Met with hostility, Elliot reveals that he had hacked him and blackmails him. The morphine he bought from Hard Andy, one of his shady clients, will provide enough money from the funeral by selling it back to Andy. Elliot wants an invitation and vows to be in the back of the funeral, listening for a good eulogy.
Elliot walks through the red tinted hall outside Angela's apartment. He knocks and asks to see if he can talk to her, saying that he's worried about her. She remains silent as he continues, saying he wishes he could snap her out of it. He moves to leave but sits with his back to the door. Elliot reminds her of the wishing game they used to play as kids, as she sits with her back to the door on the other side. They wished for bigger bedrooms, her for more protractors, him for a faster computer, her for better clothes, both for the ability to drive, to drive away on road trips. They closed their eyes and wished. Even though their wishes never came true, the ending wasn't what they cared about, it was the wishing. Angela gets emotional. Elliot didn't get it back then, but what she said to him right before they opened their eyes made it all better. "No matter what happens, we'll be okay," Angela says from behind the door.
Elliot returns home when a white van stops outside and dumps trash, including the Mr. Robot jacket. He takes it back, thinking that deletion isn't always permanent. He replaces his bathroom mirror and installs his new computer. He finds an email from Shama: a way to possibly undo the hack.

======================================================================
EPISODE: S3E09
======================================================================

Some time in 2013, Gideon Goddard meets with Tyrell Wellick , Phillip Price , and Terry Colby at Allsafe . He mentions the company's opening in 2004 and pitches its small roster as an advantage. Colby scoffs crudely at Gideon, refusing to wait a month for Allsafe to publish their 2012 financial report, for fear of putting E Corp at risk. Angela Moss enters to give Gideon a folder, and Phillip and she lock eyes for a moment. Colby tells her to refill his coffee. Gideon tries to intervene as Phillip watches intently, but Angela agrees to. In the limo back to the office, Colby complains about an afternoon wasted but Phillip decides to contract with Allsafe. Colby is caught off guard. As they enter the building, Tyrell expresses his concerns and suggests he handle cybersecurity internally. Phillip asks for his name and rejects his counsel. Tyrell gives him a final warning that the decision may come back to haunt both of them.
On the night of October 21, 2015, Tyrell is dropped off at his house by the FBI as a free man (under restrictions against international travel). Inside, Tyrell finds Joanna 's purse and their son's crib, causing him to start weeping.
At 7 AM on October 22, Elliot comes to consciousness in his bathroom, seeing "THEY OWN THE FBI" on the mirror in soap as Flipper barks. He deduces that this is Mr. Robot 's work after taking over and that "they" are the Dark Army . On his computer, he finds an open FBI pdf about "Sentinel." He thinks Mr. Robot saw Shama 's email about undoing Five/Nine and also sees an article opened about Tyrell's release from custody.
Back at 11 PM the previous night, Mr. Robot storms out at the sight of Tyrell's face. He confronts Tyrell about the 71 E Corp buildings while Tyrell confronts him about ruining his plan, as his son was taken and his wife was murdered by Derek . Mr. Robot calls Tyrell a Dark Army puppet, considering his freedom must come at a price. He insults Tyrell's wife, Joanna, causing Tyrell to put on his latex gloves and attack him. But the doorbell rings, and Tyrell opens it. It's Phillip Price. Phillip invites Mr. Robot off the floor to join the conversation at the table.
Back on 10/22, Elliot and Darlene are at the arcade . He is showing her Shama's email about Romero 's plan B to restore E Corp's data. Elliot wants intel on the FBI to get Romero's drives from the FBI's storage system, "Sentinel." Darlene calls it impossible, dismissing his plan to infiltrate it himself. She wants to go to her contact, but Elliot tells her that the Dark Army owns the FBI. She convinces him to let her try her angle and to trust her. Elliot agrees and vows to handle the Dark Army side of the equation.
Otto Irving is on a test drive with a client when the car is automatically pulled over by On Star. Elliot enters the backseat. Irving calmly tells the customer to go back to the dealership and that he will soon follow. Elliot wants him to set up a meeting with the Whiterose about Stage 3.
At night, Darlene meets with Dominique at a bar at the former's request. Darlene confirms Dominique's suspicions, explaining the Whiterose's involvement with the 5/9 hack. Darlene refuses to testify, for fear of the Dark Army. Dominique encourages her to avenge her murdered friends. Darlene excuses herself to the bathroom. She sees that her device failed to copy Dominique's FBI badge from when her bag brushed up against her earlier. Darlene decides to take off her coat, showing more of her skin, planning to seduce Dominique.
Elliot returns home as police remind people of the 9:00–4:00 curfew. He finds Angela on the stoop looking haggard. She shows him a newspaper with the cover about Tyrell's appointment as CTO and talks about things going back to the way they were. Elliot is confused and Angela tells him that the Whiterose can explain things. He dismisses her beliefs as Angela's emotions about her mom being manipulated. He takes hold of her and tells her that their parents (Emily and Edward ) aren't coming back. Angela wants to go inside because she thinks people are trying to stop them.
At the bar, Darlene opens up about her inner weakness that won't let her testify against herself. Dominique admits to also using a tough front. They establish a trust, before Darlene gets up to leave. Dominique offers her another drink to stay. They begin to discuss Dominique's single status as Darlene tries to play a potential wingwoman with the women in the bar.
As Elliot and Angela enter his apartment, they find Leon on the couch, who apologizes for what he assumes is disrupting their plans for a tryst. Angela accuses him of secretly listening to her, which Leon denies. Elliot insists that she leave. Angela believes that Elliot is in a trap to learn about the plan and stop her. Leon tells Elliot that they have business to attend to.
Back on the night of 10/21, Phillip tells Tyrell that he has been appointed CTO. He explains it as a figurehead position, inherited from a deal gone wrong. Any ambition should be quelled and obedience is required. Phillip only came to inform him out of respect and takes Tyrell's silence as acceptance. Tyrell believes that his hero status is being used for Phillip to undo his shame from firing him in the first place. Phillip scoffs, telling him that he isn't worth a move. As Phillip goes to leave, Mr. Robot accuses him of knowing about 5/9 and fsociety the whole time. Phillip says that he didn't know the minutiae, but explains that world catastrophes don't occur from lone wolves but by people like him allowing them. Mr. Robot insists that he was responsible, but Phillip explains that leaders have followers. An agenda must be inspired, not forced.
Back on the night of 10/22, Dominique and Darlene return to the former's apartment, under the understanding that the latter isn't a lesbian. Darlene questions the definition. Dominique then gets beers from the fridge but wants to get Darlene home before curfew. Darlene comments on Dominique's E-Kit making her a Girl Scout. Dominique tells her Alexa device to play music. Darlene talks about a blonde girl from the bar as Dominique admits to being drunk. Darlene kisses her, but Dominique rejects her advance. Any relationship between them would be unprofessional for her, to which Darlene points out that she isn't a CI anymore. She tries to kiss Dominique again and concedes the second refusal. Dominique eventually kisses her, then puts her gun and badge in her safe as Darlene watches. They go to bed and start making out.
At 8:28 PM, Angela locks the many locks on her front door. Her apartment is covered with photos that have the faces scratched out. Her furniture is covered in plastic tarps. She concludes aloud that she must warn the Whiterose the plan may have been overheard. Angela packs her bottled water, copies of Lolita , and rotary telephones into a cart. She dismisses a call from her dad on her cellphone, which indicates multiple ignored calls. The TV news covers a backlash against the FBI after the cyber bombings, concerning a mistrust of government. At her sink filled with unwashed dishes, Angela submerges her cellphone in a glass. She takes the intact picture of her and her mom and asks if Qwerty is ready, believing that the Whiterose will pick her up from the subway again.
Leon and Elliot find a man named Dr. Wang alone in an empty public square. Leon leaves. Dr. Wang takes Elliot's bag and brings him to meet with Grant and the two masked Dark Army soldiers. Grant asks about Stage 3. Elliot says that his laptop has the plans. As they download Elliot's data onto a USB drive, Grant insists that when they met to discuss the hack, Elliot said that there were only two stages. Elliot wants to speak with the Whiterose, but Grant insists that he will relay any message. Elliot says that ending E-Coin is the only way to truly kill E Corp. Grant says goodbye and leaves.
Angela roams the street with her cart, passing a group of soldiers. This time, she refuses a CD from a man trying to sell them. A white van parks behind her. Men in suits tell her to come with them. She complies.
Late at night, Darlene quietly gets out of bed and dresses as Dominique sleeps. Darelene opens the safe. Dominique catches her, realizing why she came here and refuses to let Darlene talk her way out.
Back on the night of 10/21, Tyrell chugs vodka as Mr. Robot paces the room. Tyrell now sees that they were used, feeling himself a prisoner once more. He believes that his CTO position is worthless, but Mr. Robot thinks they can use it to see how Phillip and the Whiterose operate. They can wait until they find the vulnerability and right time to strike. Tyrell suggests the FBI, as the Dark Army has an inside man.
In an FBI interrogation, presumably in the early morning of 10/23, Dominique questions Darlene about opening her safe. Darlene has already explained. Ernesto Santiago wants to hear the story, on camera. Darlene refuses, as her friends die whenever the FBI gets intel. She concludes they must be tied to the Dark Army. Santiago wants to hear what happened from Dominique. She explains that they had relations, which she plans to self-report, when Darlene was caught trying to steal the badge to get into Sentinel. They tell Darlene her immunity is off the table. Darlene explains that the key is to reverse 5/9, offering them the opportunity to take it to E Corp themselves and be the heroes.
In Santiago's office, Dominique expresses her belief that Darlene's plan is the whole reason for their investigation, and they should pursue it. Santiago refuses, based on Dominique's relationship possibly muddying the case. Dominique wants to know why he won't take up this no-lose scenario. He dismisses her to write a report about exactly what happened the night before and assigns a new agent to Darlene. Once Dominique leaves, Santiago is on the phone with Irving. There is the news on TV covering an imminent US cyber attack on Iran. Santiago relates Darlene's story, scared that he may be burnt, as well as her idea to undo 5/9. Irving, working on his book, asks where she is. Santiago says she's in custody and wants to know how to proceed.
The Whiterose throws a tantrum upon hearing from Grant that her project has not been shipped to the Congo after a month, not even one box having been packed. Grant says that it was due to heightened border security. The Whiterose yells about all the politicians they own. Grant says that martial law has made their contacts afraid. Grant gets permission to speak honestly and says that it is Whiterose's fault for indulging Elliot's whims. He touts his own strategy and says the attacks weren't necessary. The Whiterose says that respect comes from men like Phillip only when you force it. Grant sits with her on the couch and vows to bring a more persuasive argument to their partners. He says there's one more thing, much to the Whiterose's annoyance.
Back on the morning of 10/22, Mr. Robot is reading about Sentinel on Elliot's laptop when he suddenly becomes greatly agitated. He stumbles to the bathroom as Flipper barks, and frantically writes the message on the mirror. In the present, Elliot wipes away the message, wondering how Mr. Robot found out about the FBI's connection with the Dark Army. Elliot determines that he doesn't need him anymore and goes to enact Stage 3 while Darlene should be reporting in about Sentinel.
Grant tells the Whiterose about Elliot's plan to target E-Coin. Elliot admits to the viewer that there is no Stage 3. The Whiterose finds the new development odd. Grant tells her that Darlene is in FBI custody, claiming that she can undo 5/9, an act in opposition to Elliot. He believes that Elliot is lying and that they are his target.
In a warehouse, Elliot's exploit begins to take over the Dark Army network. The Whiterose says since Grant said that she was wrong about the attack, she may be wrong about her commitment to Elliot. She asks what Grant would do. Elliot looks at a worldwide map of locations, claiming that he now owns the Dark Army. Grant tells the Whiterose that Elliot should have to die like his father. She tells him in Mandarin to do what he thinks is right. They kiss.

EPISODE: S3E10
======================================================================

The Alderson family photo falls from the shelf as Dark Army soldiers kick in the door to Elliot's apartment. Grant sees the Mr. Robot jacket the soldiers found in the closet as his men toss the place to discern their target's whereabouts. Elliot waits in Shayla 's empty apartment next door with a whimpering Flipper . After the intruders leave, Elliot returns home and begins to worry about Darlene not responding to his texts and being targeted, all the while hoping she made it to their rendezvous point.
Darlene is asleep in the interrogation room when Ernesto Santiago disables the camera and removes the recording. He forcefully zip-ties her hands and removes her as she protests. It is the morning of 10/23. Dominique gives her report of what happened to who she believes is the agent Kaz reassigned the case, but he has no knowledge of it. She sees that both Santiago's office and the interrogation room are empty. In the garage, Santiago has Darlene in the back of his car when Dominique confronts him. She sees past his explanation of supposedly transferring her. He claims it is classified, but Darlene shakes her head in sight of Dominique. Dominique tries to call their superior, but Santiago knocks her out.
Elliot arrives at the empty arcade . He wonders if Mr. Robot was right and that the FBI caught Darlene. Looking at the Dark Army network, he sees dozens of operatives in Manhattan. He doesn't have time to search through 600,000 systems for her. He thinks hard and panics that she may die. He punches the popcorn machine and overturns a gaming cabinet. He regrets his actions concerning 5/9 and blames himself.
Outside, he buys a ticket for the Ferris wheel. On the ride, he asks Mr. Robot for help. Mr. Robot is annoyed at their lack of communication as of late. Elliot admits that he missed him and confronts him about the 71 bombings. Mr. Robot says that he didn't know. Elliot asks if he would've done it. Mr. Robot claims that he would've found another way. Elliot notes that there may be a part of Elliot in Mr. Robot and vice versa. He asks about the note on the mirror.
Santiago is driving with both Dominique and Darlene in the backseat. Dominique wakes up zip-tied. She blames him for hiding in China while the FBI were attacked (“ eps2.3_logic_b0mb.hc ”) , for leading the Dark Army to kill Francis , for the Tyrell kidnapping coverup, and for framing Sunil and Shama . Santiago claims she would've done the same in his position. Dominique protests, which he calls naïveté. He explains it as things he was forced to do. He saved her "girlfriend" Darlene's life by not revealing her to the Dark Army. He insists that he is not a bad guy, claiming that they hold stuff over him.
In Santiago's apartment, Mr. Robot points him out in a family photo, according to Tyrell. He muses that he kept the FBI off of them after 5/9. Mr. Robot hacked the desktop remotely and found nothing useful. Elliot picks drawer locks for physical evidence. Mr. Robot finds a Red Wheelbarrow menu with a cypher. As Elliot begins to decipher, Otto Irving appears behind him. Elliot concludes that they must have Darlene. Irving stops him from scheming his way out and tells him to come along.
Angela sits in a room in a fancy house. The house manager enters the room with a friendly greeting. Angela insists that she has important info for the Whiterose . The man suggests she talk to Phillip when he arrives and offers her breakfast.
Irving, Elliot, and Mr. Robot arrive at the Dark Army farmhouse next to Santiago's car. In the barn is a masked Dark Army soldier, Leon is on his phone holding a gun, and Dominique and Darlene on hay bales. Santiago tells Irving that the situation is salvageable. Irving takes note of the loose end, Dominique. Santiago demands that they clean up his mess for a change. Irving takes Dominique outside. Elliot sits next to his sister and asks if she's okay. She says no.
As they walk across the field, Dominique makes her case to Irving that she knows what they've done and they won't get away with this. Irving tells her to stop talking. In the barn, Mr. Robot is plotting and escapes, noting that Leon is good with his knife. Elliot states that he isn't trying to escape but can talk to the Whiterose, who he believes is watching them on camera.
Dominique is at the wood cutting stump where an axe waits lodged. Irving begins to take off his shirt. Santiago tells him not to kill her, as she can rise far in the FBI. Dominique vehemently refuses and begins to cry. Irving tells her to calm down and look at the sky. He plunges the axe into Santiago's chest. Irving announces that he is replacing him with Dominique. He tells Dominique that she is going back to work, business as usual, to be called upon when needed. She says fuck you and will not be a traitor. She vows to arrest him. Irving begins to name her family members and their location as he continues chopping up Santiago. He demands a verbal confirmation of her understanding, which she gives. He tells her to get back to the barn as he continues chopping Santiago for personal reasons.
Dominique reenters the barn in shock and sits on the floor. Darlene asked her what happened. Leon says she looks like she was initiated and offers her weed. Mr. Robot thinks that they all are going to be killed. Instead, Elliot knows that they're waiting for someone important to arrive.
Grant arrives by car. Irving is dressed and is cleaning his hands by the house. He claims that he has taken care of everything, noting he had to kill the FBI mole, much to Grant's annoyance. However, he claims that Dominique has upsides as the new mole. He goes back to his car when Grant asks where he is going. Irving says his overdue sabbatical so he can finish his book, maybe in Barbados. Grant says that they have work to do. Irving gets into Grant's face, grabbing him. He notes that the Whiterose is prone to spontaneous overtures. He wonders if she has made him taste her yet. Irving tells him that he was in Grant's position years ago and says that she would be good with him instead. Irving walks away.
The following two sequences cut between each other rapidly.
1. Grant enters the barn with two Dark Army soldiers. Everyone rises. Grant says that he has reviewed Stage 3, but Elliot interrupts to admit it is bullshit. Now that they can talk honestly. Elliot demands Dominique and Darlene to be let go. He admits to taking over the entire Dark Army network with infected malware. Everything will be released. Grant laughs, calling it impossible. As proof, Elliot notes that seven days ago, the Russians bribed the Dark Army to hack the DNC. The Dark Army has also recently installed backdoors into South Korea's military and helped Phillip Price annex the Congo for China. Elliot threatens him that if one of them dies, it all leaks. Grant notes that the Dark Army can survive the leaks.
A soldier forces Darlene to kneel. Elliot claims that he can help move the project to the Congo. Leon receives a message on his phone. The soldier puts his gun to Darlene's head. Elliot is restrained. He looks up into the Whiterose's camera. Grant dismisses him as one person against an army. Elliot declares that he is better, touting what he did in one night to take down E Corp versus what they tried months to do. He is forced to kneel. Elliot pleads. Grant says that he's sorry. Elliot and Darlene gaze at one another. Grant raise his gun to Elliot. Leon shoots the three Dark Army soldiers. Grant's phone starts ringing. Grant must be snapped out of his shock by Leon to answer the call.
The Whiterose on the line from her bath. She tells Grant that jealousy has blinded him to Elliot's usefulness. Grant says that Elliot is lying. The Whiterose promises to find him when the project is complete. Their time has come to an end. She tells him that she loves him. Grant drops the phone. He speaks Mandarin to Elliot, telling him to "take care of her" and shoots himself in the head. Leon takes out a laptop and has Elliot come through on his offer. Elliot hacks the Coast Guard so that an international aid shipment to Iran can transport the project. Leon says he doesn't need to tell Elliot will happen if it doesn't go through but also proclaims he has faith in Elliot. Mr. Robot asks what they will do now. Undo the hack, Elliot says.
2. Angela is sitting on a bench at the luxurious estate when Phillip walks up to her. She wants to leave, claiming that she wouldn't have come here if she knew who was taking her. Phillip explains he was concerned because she hadn't been to work in weeks and wasn't answering his emails and texts. Angela says she wants to be with the Whiterose, to which Phillip says that he knows about the Whiterose's delusional plan. Phillip had Colby hire Angela so Phillip could get her to drop the contingency in the Washington Township lawsuit. Otherwise the Whiterose would have simply killed Angela. He goes on to reveal that he had met her mother Emily 32 years ago. They dated. He loved her, but never told her so as to torture her and make himself feel strong.
When Emily found out she was pregnant, she wouldn't allow her child to be raised by a "monster." Emily then married Angela's stepfather . He laments what the Whiterose has done to Angela, claiming that the plan is not possible, but simply a denial of reality. The Whiterose murdered countless people for a fantasy. Angela doesn't believe him, asserting that he is lying. Phillip says, "I am your father, biologically speaking." Angela cries over the bombings and her role. Angela wants to know why. "Pettiness," Phillip explains, a dig at him. Angela doesn't want to believe that it's over, rather that her mom will come back and they can be reunited. Phillip begins to walk away. Angela asks what he is going to do to the Whiterose. Angela wants retribution. Phillip says that she can only accept that she's been conned and to find a way to live with what she did.
Dominique and Elliot get into the car. It's a little after 2:30PM. She logs into Sentinel, saying that she's not doing it for him. She gets out of the car. Darlene wants to talk to her. Dominique calls her a terrible person who deserves agony for having taken everything from Dominique and ruining her life. She tells Darlene to live and die with that.
Darlene gets in the car with Elliot. He decrypts the file, only to find Romero was just spying. Someone else exported the key data to reverse 5/9. Darlene wonders who did it.
The Aldersons are riding the subway as the soldiers are reminding riders of the 9PM curfew. Darlene asks Elliot why he recently brought up the snowman they built. Elliot notes that it was the day their father pushed him out of the window. Darlene disputes it. She explains that he was looking for the camera when he started freaking out. Edward came home and Elliot snapped and started swinging a baseball bat, breaking things in his room. Elliot doesn't believe it, but Darlene insists that she remembers. Elliot had said he was going to jump out the window and then he did. Elliot says he doesn't remember any of it, to which she says she's there to remember for him. At their stop, Elliot wants to ride a little longer and promises to get it done. As she leaves, she notes that Shama must've sent that email to him because she trusted him, as she does.
Elliot is alone in the subway car when Mr. Robot arrives and sits across from him. Elliot tells him to come with him at the next stop.
They are sitting on a bench at the stop where they first had their conversation (“ eps1.0_hellofriend.mov ”) . Elliot says that Mr. Robot exported the keys and asks why. Mr. Robot says what the hack has done is close to success. He doesn't want everything to be for nothing, a huge cost for something he still believes in. Mr. Robot questions if it would help anything. Elliot admits that he's doing it for himself, that he can't live with what he did. He says that Mr. Robot is wrong, they won't win. One good thing came from all of this: they showed themselves, the top 1% of the 1%. Elliot's gonna take them down—all of them. Mr. Robot wants to keep talking and be a team. He admits that he can't force him, so he's asking. Elliot notes that he wasn't pushed out the window, but jumped.
A small gathering watches a TV in a store window, the scene from Superman the Movie where Superman goes back in time. Elliot walks past the crowd, a street preacher, a line of people waiting for food. He thinks of what Mr. Robot just told him in the subway. He sent the backup data in case they were wrong or failed. It's what Elliot would've done, admitting that there's a part of Elliot in Mr. Robot. He doesn't exist to be an independent agent. Only Elliot knows why he's here. Mr. Robot transferred the keys to the computer at home and burned it onto a CD. The seed data is in one of the family picture. Elliot will know the one, where he and his dad dressed up as Doc and Marty McFly for Halloween. It will restore E Corp's data. It is 8:24 PM. Elliot prepares an email to the E Corp recovery team. Subject: "Key to decrypt." From the address Falkensmaze. After pausing, Elliot hits the send button.
Post-credits: A car drives down the street. It almost hits Darlene and a prostitute she's talking to in the crosswalk. On the sidewalk, they're talking about the economic crisis hitting everybody hard. Darlene says that things are gonna change and get better. The woman mentions that the US is preparing to attack Iran. Darlene says E Corp might get its data back, which would be good. The woman counters that people being in debt again, including her student loan, isn't going to help them. The economy doesn't just bounce back, she contends—that's not how capitalism works. She suggests that Darlene brush up on Marx. The only thing that can fix it all is an act of God. They arrive outside of Elliot's apartment, Darlene saying that she was glad they met tonight. The same car that almost hit them parks across the street, causing the prostitute to avoid them and later leaving. A group of four men emerge and approach Darlene. She asks if she can help them, sarcastically. The leader talks about the North star, the cosmos, and his dark mind. The brave traveler has come home. It is Fernando Vera .

EPISODE: S4E01
======================================================================

As the opening recap ends with Angela meeting with Phillip outside his palatial estate, it seamlessly flows into the beginning of the episode. Angela tearfully wants to play a role in retribution against the Whiterose for the E Corp bombings. Phillip tells her to simply learn how to live with it. Angela insists that the Whiterose's project is real and that she's seen it, and she knows how to take it from her. She wants to expose the plot, but Phillip yells at her to shut up. She declares that she'll do it herself, but when she moves to walk toward the house, something catches her eyes as a door opens and closes. Phillip explains that all he wants is to protect her from the Whiterose, imploring her to beg for forgiveness. Angela tells him to remove his emotions from his panicked state. She returns to the bench, resolute that she will not run. Phillip walks back to the house, removing a hidden microphone from his shirt, as two Dark Army soldiers arrive and shoot Angela in the back of the head.
Inside, Phillip hurls a vase at the floor. He receives a call from the Whiterose, who tells him that Angela made her choice. Phillip blames the Whiterose for recruiting her. The Whiterose accepts his lashing out calmly and ends the call.
On her island, the Whiterose stares out at the ocean and hands the phone to her assistant Wang Shu . Wang informs her that Elliot's shipment hack will deliver the project by the end of the year, in two months time. Wang says that Elliot cannot be trusted. The Whiterose says that once the project is delivered, Elliot can be terminated. Wang says that he must be kept on a short leash and trained to not bite his master. The Whiterose allows her to send him a reminder of the consequences.
It's December 21, Christmastime in NYC. At a holiday party at the office of Lomax & Looney Law , Freddy Lomax is being a sexist jerk to his assistant, who gives him a package. The letter disturbs him enough to send him to his office. On his TV, he plays the CD he just received of his sexual video chat with an underage girl. The phone rings from inside the package. Freddy answers Mr. Robot 's call. He directs him to open his email. Freddy tries to barter for silence, but Mr. Robot does not care about money. Freddy is forced to copy his email inbox onto a USB drive before leaving his electronics behind and heading to Grand Central Station. Mr. Robot watches from outside.
Freddy gets into a cab. The news on TV covers the economic boom from the 5/9 reversal . The praise falls on E Corp, E Coin, and CTO Tyrell Wellick .
Inside Grand Central Station, Freddy is guided by the all-seeing eye of Mr. Robot to buy a ticket from the furthest kiosk as Dark Army operatives arrive on scene. The coke-addled lawyer is anxious, but Mr. Robot coaches him on how to lose the tail: by throwing a wad of money into a busker's case so the Dark Army will frantically search it for a moment. Freddy is directed to a train car where Elliot waits with his laptop.
Freddy pulls a gun on Elliot, but Elliot has the video ready to be sent to the FBI and Freddy's family. Elliot looks through Freddy's emails and attachments. He tracks the money Freddy funnels for Zhi Zhang (the Whiterose) to Cyprus National Bank . Elliot pushes him for more information, a contact, though he claims to be a low-level paper pusher. Freddy gives the name John Garcin . He says that the address is at his office. Elliot notices that the Dark Army soldiers are coming toward the train and realizes that Freddy's ID tag is Bluetooth enabled. Elliot has them split up to rendezvous outside while leaving the tag in the car. Over the phone, Freddy is fearful of the Dark Army. Hearing Elliot's silence indicating that he can't protect him, Freddy kills himself with his gun on the street corner. Elliot runs to join the crowd around the body.
December 22, the next day, Tyrell walks into E Corp as his assistant Elizabeth informs him of his busy day of meetings and appearances. In his office, he asks to postpone anything until tomorrow. He can't. He asks for a minute. Elizabeth thanks him for his heroism. Alone, Tyrell stares ahead blankly.
At her mom's house, Dominique looks like a wreck struggling to stay awake in the middle of the day. She is suspicious of a car parked in the driveway. Peeking out of her door, she sees a strange man ascending the stairs. She gets her gun and confronts him. Her mom, Trudy , finds them and explains that he's renovating the bathroom, as she told her last week she planned to have done. Dominique insists that she vet anyone her mom hires. Trudy laughs it off and goes to go the mall walking with Janice , who she met at church and wants to set up with Dominique. Trudy tells her that Janice is coming over for dinner.
In the now abandoned Allsafe office, Mr. Robot searches through John Garcin's boring social media while Elliot adds his name to a conspiracy web. Elliot wants to go to his address, believing him to be a liaison to Cyprus National Bank, while Mr. Robot wants to do more research to break him as they always do. Elliot won't wait another two weeks, as the Whiterose will kill them once her project is delivered. Elliot ignores a call from Darlene . Mr. Robot takes note of Elliot's cold demeanor. He tells Elliot to put aside his own anger. Elliot explains that if they rob the bank, they will stop the Whiterose. Mr. Robot claims what they once started to save the world is now clouded about his feelings for Angela. Elliot points it out that society has forgotten about 5/9 and the bombings in place of Christmas commercialism and that if they don't do something, the Whiterose will get away with it. Elliot is done with his feelings; his only focus is the Whiterose. Mr. Robot reads a text from Darlene, telling Elliot about Angela.
At his apartment, Elliot lets in Darlene, who is frantic. She asks about Flipper . Elliot gave him to his landlord for the week. Darlene wonders what her brother is busy with. She goes on to say that she thinks she saw Angela. Elliot is dismissive. Mr. Robot tells her that Angela is gone and asks if Darlene is on drugs. Darlene dodges the question. She recounts seeing Angela at a shelter but losing her in the crowd. Her body was never found, after all. Darlene insists that she was wearing her same crazy outfit from before she was taken. Elliot blames the cocaine. Darlene fights with him for shutting down. Elliot gets in her face, declaring that Angela is dead and it's not their fault. Darlene leaves. Mr. Robot asks why on he didn't just show Darlene the photo the Whiterose sent of Angela's body. We see a quick flash of the image. Elliot didn't want to break her heart. Now he wants to get back to work.
Mr. Robot begins narrating to the audience as he watches Elliot gather documents. He explains that Elliot hasn't been talking much since Angela's death. Distracting himself from the pain, like everyone does during the holidays. Mr. Robot rants about Christmas fakeness while they travel. He admits to bringing in the audience not because he likes them, but because Elliot does.
They arrive at an apartment building owned by E Corp. Mr. Robot wants to be cautious, but Elliot heads in. Inside, the security guard pours a bowl of cereal while a nearby man talks loudly on FaceTime in Samoan. Elliot tells the security guard that he has a delivery for John Garcin. The guard directs them upstairs. There, they find the apartment door ajar. They enter, close the door, and search all over the place, though Mr. Robot reminds Elliot the plan was to just take over the Wi-Fi. No one is there, and the apartment appears staged: everything is covered in dust and there's no sign anyone ever lived there. They realize the door is now locked and the phone signal is jammed. Elliot finds a book on the shelf, No Exit by Jean-Paul Sartre. He realizes that "John Garcin" is a name taken from the book and that they were set up by Freddy. It's a honeypot.
The guard plays "Don't Worry Be Happy" by Bobby McFerrin on an old iPod while two men drag Elliot away.
At the DiPierro house, Trudy, Dominique, and Janice sit around the dinner table. Trudy tells a story about an attractive nun at their church, asking Janice if she also finds her attractive. Janice seems embarrassed. Trudy calls it a night and asks Dominique to help Janice take the leftovers home. Outside, Janice reassures Dominique that the dead animals in her car are because she's a taxidermist. Dominique tries to make small talk. She apologizes about her mom setting them up. They talk about Dominique's recent stress, as told by Trudy to Janice. Dominique says goodnight. Janice tells her to get some sleep for her Santiago interview in the morning. Dominique is alarmed. Janice says that Dominique has put it off for weeks and it looks suspicious. She says unless Dominique cleans up Santiago's mess, Janice will kill her mother. Dominique threatens Janice with death if she touches her mom. Janice laughs it off, saying killing her won't stop the others. Dominique notices the vans down the street.
Darlene does a line of coke at a party at Angela's apartment. The other people comment on the decor: the etched out photos. Darlene swallows a pill she just got a friend. She notices a bunch of people in the bedroom. Some girls are digging through Angela's closet, tossing aside ballet shoes and commenting snarkily. Darlene yells at them and tells everyone to leave. She then collapses on the bed and cries.
In his apartment, Elliot is being held in a chair by two men while a third silently prepares a heroin needle. Elliot threatens that if the Whiterose is listening, he can expose her shipment. He pleads with his captors. He's hurt so many people, and he wants to put things right. Invoking Cyprus National Bank gets the third man to pause a moment. Still, the third man approaches Elliot, who has been screaming at him to say something. "Goodbye, friend," he says, injecting the drug into Elliot's arm. The men leave. Elliot collapses and tries unsuccessfully to reach the phone. He sees his parents and his younger self talking about his impending death, that they will all go away. The events of the past year flash before his eyes before they close. The credits briefly begin before the episode resumes. Someone sprays Narcan into Elliot's nose, rousing him. It's the three men. Phillip Price walks in. "Welcome back, Mr. Alderson."

EPISODE: S4E02
======================================================================

A test pattern on a TV screen is shown. Phillip narrates that when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, and the Soviet Union soon after, the world was up for grabs. A young Zhang saw the possibilities and formed an investment group called the Deus Group . Images appear on the TV of different world leaders: Castro, Putin, Assad, Obama, and others, often with Minister Zhang. The Deus Group made a lot of money on oil from the Gulf War, and Zhang sought to grow more power. The rise of the Internet connected the world, using America as a prime test subject. People put all their information online. The Whiterose began construction of her billion dollar machine underneath Washington Township. Phillip eventually realized that they were all working for her.
The day after Elliot's near death experience, December 23, Phillip is looking over Elliot's conspiracy board in the abandoned Allsafe office. He explains that he had been tasked with killing Elliot. Mr. Robot narrates the crazy situation—that their longtime enemy saved them, but at what cost. Elliot ignores a call from Darlene . Phillip says that the heist won't work, as the Deus Group is impenetrable. Elliot believes that Phillip can use E Corp to get them in. Phillip says his liaison at Cyprus National Bank was Susan Jacobs , but she disappeared months ago. Elliot challenges Phillip to stop the ones who killed his daughter, Angela . Elliot reveals that he looked into Phillip. He asks him how he justifies all he's done and if he realizes what the Whiterose is doing is wrong. Phillip reiterates that the heist is impossible. Elliot says they have only eight days until the project is delivered. If Phillip doesn't fight back, he might as well be dead. Phillip replies that both of them became dead men walking as soon as they decided to work with the Whiterose. After Phillip leaves, Elliot tells Mr. Robot that Phillip will be back. They have to find Susan Jacobs. Darlene calls, telling him that their mother, Magda , is dead.
At the nursing home, a nurse gives her condolences to Elliot and Darlene. They coldly tell her that they simply want to donate their mother's belongings. The nurse leaves them to pack up. Darlene apologies for her attitude the previous day. Elliot says that they're cool, as he starts putting their mother's things in a box. Darlene puts on one of her mother's coats and smokes by the window. She asks if Elliot feels any relief as she claims to be happy. Elliot finds his old Walkman in a drawer. Darlene puts it in her bag. She looks through a jewelry box and finds a receipt for a Bank of E safety deposit box.
At the FBI , Dominique is in an interview with Agent Horton . He asks about Ernesto Santiago and how Dominique knew him, how she would describe him as a boss. Horton asks about Santiago's disappearance on October 23. He reminds Dominique that erasing security footage is suspicious. Dominique asks for water. She slowly works up to tell Horton that she believes Santiago was a double agent. After more prodding, she says she is fearful of repercussions, and ties him to a drug cartel.
At her taxidermy store, Janice is working on a deer while listening to a Charles Manson story. She receives a call from Dominique in her ASAC office. The cover story was delivered. Janice writes down the name of Agent Horton and asks how sure she is that Horton believes her story. Dominique says 99.9%. A woman enters the store and Janice gives a cheery goodbye to Dominique. The woman puts her dead dog, Bernice, on the counter and declares she wants to be with her forever.
At a funeral home, Mr. Robot reads a pamphlet and muses about the cost of living and dying. Elliot is focused on finding Susan Jacobs while they wait for the death certificate. Mr. Robot questions if Elliot is bottling his emotions and that he should take a moment or else the death of his mother will eat away at him. Elliot is more concerned about the Whiterose killing them all and walks away.
Darlene looks through a choice of coffins. She tells the funeral director that she didn't know the last time she spoke with her mother, let alone her last wishes. Elliot walks in to say they want her cremated in a cardboard casket and put in the cheapest urn.
While waiting for the subway, Darlene wonders about the contents of the safe deposit box. Elliot is reading about Susan Jacobs and the possible fsociety connection to her disappearance. Darlene says there may be secrets in the box. She takes his phone, as he is ignoring her, but he quickly snatches it back. Darlene insists that if they really are on good terms, he will come with her to the bank. She reminds him that when they were kids and he would have an episode, he could squeeze her hand to remind him that everything was real. Now she needs his help. If there's nothing in the box, it will be a short trip. As he gets up to catch a train, a man in a snowman costume who had been sitting next to them says his condolences.
In an FBI interrogation room, Dominique and agent Hartman question an Irish mobster named Deegan Maguire , accused of helping other criminals disappear. Dominique receives a text from Janice, giving her condolences for her coworker. Agent Kaz enters, telling Dominique she needs to see something. On the news, a man committed suicide by jumping from a building. Kaz reveals that it was Agent Horton. Janice sends another text, that her 99.9% should've been 100%.
At Bank of E, an employee tells the Aldersons that the box was discarded two years after payments stopped. He leaves when Darlene yells at him for throwing it out. Elliot wants to go and pick up the ashes. Darlene sits down, sad. Elliot asks what's going on. Darlene says that he doesn't give a shit, not about their mom, but about Angela. She really is gone. Darlene wonders how Elliot can just move on, but he says he hasn't. He takes out the Walkman and inside is a cassette tilted "Happy Mother's Day." Darlene wonders how their mom had possession of it, as it wasn't for her. Elliot presumes that she wished it were for her. She was lonely. Darlene listens to it and smiles. Elliot joins her. It is them and Angela as kids, wishing Emily Moss a happy Mother's Day.
In an elegant room, Zhang is putting up ornaments on a large Christmas tree. Phillip enters and says, "You're unbalanced," referring to the tree. He reveals that he is resigning as CEO of E Corp at the end of the year. Zhang tells him that is unacceptable and questions Phillip's loyalty. Phillip says that he is leaving with what little he has left. The Deus Group must meet in person to approve his successor, a task Zhang knows is absurd to make happen in a week. As Phillip leaves, Zhang yells that this isn't how their game is played. Phillip says that Zhang has won. After Phillip leaves, an enraged Zhang topples the Christmas tree.
At the funeral home, Elliot receives a call from Phillip. He has played his hand and now they wait. Elliot thanks him, but Phillip isn't doing it for him. Darlene enters with the urn. She reveals that she saw Elliot's phone earlier and asks why he is hacking Susan Jacobs. She says she knew her and that the last Ecoin transaction to the animal shelter was from her, not Susan. Darlene recounts how fsociety needed a new location and that Susan returned early. Elliot is angry. He then tells her that he knows what Susan Jacobs did for the Washington Township lawsuit. He needs everything Darlene has on her, as Susan worked with the Dark Army . Darlene is shocked to hear that Elliot is going after the Whiterose, saying that it's suicide. She discerns that Elliot is trying to protect her, even at the inevitable cost of his own life. Darlene wants to join him. She links their phones to share their locations.
Darlene says that she thought he was focused on Fernando Vera . Elliot is confused as to why she brought up his name. Darlene recounts that Vera freaked her out in October, but when she told Elliot then, he brushed it off. Elliot looks over to Mr. Robot sitting sitting nearby, who returns a glance. Darlene leaves to get her info on Susan Jacobs. Mr. Robot doesn't know what Darlene is talking about, but Elliot yells at him about needing to trust each other. Mr. Robot gets in close and insists that he truly doesn't know what she was talking about. Elliot wonders who Darlene was talking to about Vera, if it was neither of them.
At a meeting room overlooking the New York skyline, the same room Tyrell offered Elliot a job in after the arrest of Terry Colby (“ eps1.1_ones-and-zer0es.mpeg ”) , a boy is spinning in a chair. He's Elliot. A younger version of Elliot's mom, Magda, enters, saying she's been looking all over for him. She tells him to get out of the chair. He's not ready. They have to wait. The boy asks for who, "Mr. Robot?" "No." "Elliot?" Magda says no, it's the other one. They both leave.

EPISODE: S4E03
======================================================================

In 1982, IBM executives are in a meeting with a Chinese executive, Zhi Zhang , and his translator, Chen . The Americans want to finalize a deal to open a facility in Asia. The Chinese men are largely ignoring them, sharing romantic notions in their own language. The deal is reached, and the executive jokes (in Mandarin) how he'll enjoy stealing IBM's intellectual property. Later, Zhang and Chen are having a romantic moment in a hotel room. They are looking forward to Zhang becoming the ambassador to the US so they can move to a country where they can be themselves. Chen's watch beeps, annoying Zhang. Their next meeting is in 15 minutes, so Chen leaves to take a shower. When he returns, Zhang tells him to go alone. They kiss.
When Chen returns later that night, Zhang tells him not to turn on the light. Zhang appears in a wig and dress: "It was my mother's." Zhang admires its simplicity and elegance. Chen calls Zhang beautiful and they kiss. In the present, Minister Zhang hangs up the dress and tells Wang Shu that he wants it ready to wear on the day the project ships. Wang warns him of celebrating too early. Freddy Lomax 's suicide coincided with a hacker taking over Grand Central, not an easy feat. At the same time, Phillip wants to resign. It's not a coincidence, it's Elliot's next move. Zhang says to refuse Phillip's demands and surveil Elliot. Wang tells Zhang to have patience. The word bothers Zhang.
Sometime later in the past, Chinese people are having an extravagant party. Zhang asks the bride-to-be about the groom and finds him in the dressing room. The groom-to-be, Chen, is distressed, as his father is forcing him to marry the woman to keep up appearances. Chen wants to leave China. Zhang tries to convince him to put on a good show for his father, and later they can be together. They discuss that Zhang was not made US ambassador but Minister of State Security, so he will be able amass power in Beijing. He tells Chen to be patient, but Chen thinks to be patient is to surrender. Zhang assures him that since Zhang trusted him with his secret, they will make a better world. They kiss, but the groom needs a moment. He grabs a knife. He declares the world will never be good enough and cuts his own throat, blood spraying on the white roses, a joke Zhang sent to him as funeral flowers. Zhang screams in terror over the body.
In the present, Zhang says to arrange a Deus Group meeting tomorrow to give Phillip his resignation. Wang says that it cannot be done on Christmas. Zhang wants to destabilize Phillip's timeline and force him into a mistake. They will call Tyrell Wellick and make him CEO, on the orders of the Whiterose. Zhang gazes longingly at the dress.
Elliot and Mr. Robot are walking on the sidewalk. Mr. Robot narrates that playing Russian roulette, hearing the click, the sound of cheating death, changes you. He wonders what Vera's up to. Elliot won't listen to anything, putting up his Forbidden Error on the walls. They run into Krista and her friend Jason . Elliot tries to talk with her, to thank her and say that he's doing better, but Krista insists that she will take legal action if he makes contact with her. As Elliot walks away, a man on a cell phone follows.
At the abandoned Allsafe office, Darlene explains that Susan Jacobs ' contact at Cyprus National Bank was Olivia Cortez . Elliot can't find a digital way in; they need her laptop. Darlene notes that Elliot chose Allsafe for emotional reasons, while he dismisses it as technical. He explains that Olivia's ex-husband has their kid tonight, and she has a date at a bar. Darlene doesn't want to be sidelined and wants to do the breaking and entering thing. Elliot lets Mr. Robot try to talk some sense into her. She lights a cigarette at the thought of danger. Elliot grabs her hard. She is alarmed, asking if it's really him. She concludes that their relationship will never change and he won't get better. He says he never should've opened the door when she came back to town.
Elliot breaks into Olivia Cortez's house. Mr. Robot wonders what the term is for someone who's lost everyone: survivor or time-bomb. He checks the personal laptop. Elliot searches the bathroom and finds a bottle of Oxycontin. In the bedroom, he unlocks a drawer and hacks her work laptop. Mr. Robot looks through the lame social media of her date, a man named Evan Floyd . Elliot finds that her laptop has high security. Mr. Robot wonders if she left her USB key around the place. Elliot notes that she's a single mom who's worked hard to get where she is, so she isn't that careless. Elliot looks at the picture of Evan Floyd.
At the bar, Elliot and Mr. Robot watch as Olivia appears to have been stood up. Elliot notes that she has an addiction problems, and if she's caught up with Oxycontin, she would lose custody of her child, so she can be blackmailed. Mr. Robot doesn't want to take that brutish a route. Elliot approaches Olivia but finds himself at a loss introducing himself. Mr. Robot intervenes, sweet talking her into a drink. Olivia agrees, for Christmas. The USB key is clipped to her bag.
At a small restaurant, a boy enters the kitchen. Fernando Vera is running a small smuggling operation, putting drug packets in uncooked chickens and handing them out to a line of kids for their mothers. The man with the cell phone, DJ , enters. He brings up no news of following Elliot, much to Vera's irritation. Vera reminds him that he came back to NY, despite the danger, to work with Elliot and take over the city. DJ just wants to put a gun to Elliot's head, but Vera adamantly refuses to take him prisoner. DJ says that Elliot is just alone most of the time. He recounts the argument with a woman, Krista, and shows Vera the picture he took of their encounter. Vera has a boy describe the picture, and the boy deduces (based on experience with his own mother) that the woman is making the man sad. Vera realizes that she hurt Elliot deeply, so she must know something about him. Vera then kills DJ for his incompetence.
At the bar, Olivia asks Elliot about his Christmas Eve sob story. Elliot gives her the bare minimum: He has nowhere to be after arguing with his sister, and his mom Magda died yesterday. Olivia talks about how she and her dad weren't close as well, especially after her own mother died in Colombia. Elliot says that he is addicted to morphine. They have an ironically comical conversation about his drug habits of late. Evan eventually appears at the table, but Olivia claims to not know him. She leaves. As she's trying to flag down a cab outside, Elliot kisses her. At her place, they make out and disrobe.
Later, as Olivia lies under the covers, Elliot is getting dressed. He goes into the bathroom and texts Olivia's key code to Darlene. He's just stuffed the key fob into his pocket when Olivia walks in. As they sit on the floor, she explains that the drugs ruined her relationship with her dad. She was ruined after her mom was murdered. She reveals that the Oxycontin bottle has a razor blade in it: If she ever hated herself enough to start again, she might as well kill herself. Elliot gets it—hating yourself. He almost killed himself. What stopped him was promising to take a kid to see The Martian . (“ eps3.7_dont-delete-me.ko ”) Olivia says that has been enough crazy enough for one night but that there's more.
As Elliot and Mr. Robot wait for the subway, Mr. Robot narrates that Olivia was able to override Elliot's walls and convince him to let people in. They enter the train car. Outside on the street, Elliot noticed a van following them, and figures it must be the Dark Army. He says to show the Whiterose they have nothing to hide. They go home. The apartment door has been busted in. Mr. Robot narrates that maybe their game of Russian roulette is over. They can't run, as the van is outside. Inside, Tyrell awaits. He wants to tell Elliot that the Whiterose has offered him the position of CEO, and this is their chance to take them down from the inside, but Elliot shuts him up. He writes down that they are listening. The van awaits outside.

======================================================================
EPISODE: S4E04
======================================================================

A man inside the van outside Elliot's apartment is listening to Elliot's conversation with Tyrell. Elliot tries to act casual and says that he is booting up his computer. The eavesdropper's audio becomes distorted and he leaves to check the antenna outside. Tyrell knocks him out with a hammer as soon as the door opens. Elliot joins him, distressed. Tyrell tells him to check if the audio logs were sent to the Dark Army . They're taking the van. The man is dead.
On another street, Darlene is calling Elliot. She records a voicemail saying that Olivia Cortez 's account didn't have good enough access to Cyprus National Bank. They have to break into Virtual Realty . She is outside scouting it now, as security is lax on Christmas Eve. The Deus Group 's meeting is tomorrow so they have to hurry. She is mad that Elliot didn't meet her at the abandoned Allsafe like he said. She is going to his apartment. She unleashes hate upon him and wishes for his suicide. Darlene deletes the voicemail and starts over.
Dominique is in bed, masturbating to video of Darlene's FBI interview. She gives up and logs onto a sex chatroom. She meets her old internet friend Happy Hard On Harry . Darlene enters Elliot's apartment. She finds the note where Elliot wrote "They're listening." She uses her phone to locate Elliot.
At a gas station upstate, Mr. Robot notes that the audio logs weren't sent. Now they have to dump the body. Tyrell pumps gas. Mr. Robot wants to buy shovels, but Tyrell tells him to just pay for the gas and buy a lighter. Inside the store, the cashier tells them that the internet and Ecoin are down. Tyrell pays in cash. The cashier wonders where she knows his face. He denies it at first, then agrees that he was on Big Brother . When they go outside, the van is gone.
Darlene breaks into a car and boots up her laptop. A drunk mall Santa chases her off and threatens to call the police on her. Darlene convinces him that he doesn't want the hassle. The mall Santa asks if she can start the car, as he's lost his keys and a taxi won't bring him upstate. Darlene agrees to drive him there and use his car for an errand. She exchanges names with Tobias .
In the store, the cashier says that only the nearby town has cell service and that it's too far to walk. She at last realizes who Tyrell is. Mr. Robot yells at her to tell them about the shortcut she had mentioned: across the street, take the trail, left at the creek, 30 minutes to town. Meanwhile, Dominique feel asleep and hasn't responded to her chatroom. They decide to meet up, as she learns that Harry is a woman. Dominique invites her over to her place.
In the woods, Mr. Robot wonders if this is the right trail. Tyrell marvels at the quiet and asks Elliot if he ever considers leaving everything behind and starting all over. Tyrell does. Elliot says no. They continue walking. Mr. Robot says they should've seen the creek by now, it's been hours. Tyrell and Elliot then start bickering that they're lost. There is an eerie howl in the distance. Tyrell wonders if it's a dog or a wolf. Elliot wants to keep going. Tyrell says that the cashier knew his face and can ID him. Mr. Robot narrates about the notion of searching and not finding.
Darlene drives the car with the drunken mall Santa, Tobias, nodding out in the passenger seat. She checks her messages—nothing from Elliot. Tobias mumbles about a man named Jimmy being a good guy, but when the world kicks you down, you wonder if it's better to just be gone. Meanwhile, Tyrell is singing in Swedish, annoying Elliot. Tyrell declares that Elliot wears the same black clothes all the time because he doesn't care. Tyrell wears a silk tie and $6,000 suit because he cares about other's approval, and he's a failure. When they first met at Allsafe, Elliot didn't care about the important executives walking around. Tyrell says they're going to die. Maybe not tonight, but the Dark Army solider will eventually report in. They hear a car driving and conclude they must be close to town. They unsuccessfully chase after the car and realize they're back at the gas station.
Darlene asks Tobias about his Santa outfit. He volunteers at a cancer hospital and gets drunk with friends afterward. Darlene thinks that it's cool. It may be the last time he does it. Some kids are so small, they seem born to die. Darlene figures that he must get drunk to deal with that. Tobias says that it was easier with his wife, but then the accident happened. From his pocket, he takes out a bottle of alcohol and a bottle of Percocet. He explains that sometimes the pain is too much.
"Happy Hard On Harry" is in Dominique's apartment. They share a drink. Dominique says that the sex chat allows everything to be imaginary and for her to be in control. They kiss, but Dominique hesitates at getting too handsy. She excuses herself to the bathroom, which is strewn with rose petals and lit candles. When she turns around, Harry is wearing a Dark Army mask and begins to drown Dominique in the bathtub. She tells her to give up control and that she will never be free. Dominique stops struggling. She wakes up from her nightmare, her laptop still on her chest. Happy Hard On Harry logged off four hours ago. Dominique checks her phone, with a Christmas message from Mom at 3:38 AM.
Darlene pulls up to a house alight in Christmas decorations. A car just like the one they're in is in the driveway. Tobias realizes that is his car, as his friend drove him. He doesn't know who's car they're in now. He gets out, saying "goodbye is short and final." Darlene gets out and tells him to not hurt himself. Tobias is confused. He explains that Jimmy is from "It's a Wonderful Life," the "goodbye" quote is Steinbeck, and the Percocet are for his wife, who hurt her back in an accident the previous day. Darlene says that she was scared for him. He asks is she's okay. She claims she is. Tobias turns to leave, but Darlene begins to blurt out that she has lost everyone in her life but her brother. She worries that he is dead but he has pushed her away. Tobias unlocks his front door.
Walking the desolate road, Elliot checks the time and realizes that it's Christmas. Tyrell says they're nowhere near town and it must be swarming with Dark Army anyway. He stops to sit down, as there's a rock in his shoe. He says that Elliot never cared about him. Elliot eventually agrees. The distant cry haunts them. Tyrell gives up at the sound of death. Mr. Robot sits beside Tyrell. After badgering by Tyrell, Elliot screams that he never needed Tyrell. That he doesn't care if Tyrell dies. Tyrell tells Elliot that he hasn't realized that it's over. Elliot walks away.
Darlene sits in the car as Mr. Robot narrates about lost things. Elliot returns. He tells Tyrell that he is wrong, that Elliot doesn't like being an outsider. It felt wrong to leave Tyrell. He's the only one who likes Elliot. Elliot says that he realized that they were dead since the van went missing. He explains to him that he continues on for his sister, to try to warn her and make up for being a horrible brother. Tyrell wonders how long until they are found. Another screech in the night. Tyrell gets up and starts walking.
Tobias knocks on Darlene's window. He tells her to start worrying about herself and hopes that her brother's not dead. Merry Christmas. His wife comes out of the house to meet him.
The men come across a dead deer in the road. Farther down, they find the van crashed on the side of the road. Meanwhile, Darlene pulls over on the highway and screams in distress. Elliot peeks in the van's passenger side but ducks down as the driver shoots at him. After a pause, Elliot looks again to see that the man kill himself. Tyrell has been shot in the stomach. Elliot says they need to get him to a hospital. Tyrell thinks that will only tip off the Dark Army, and they'll find Elliot. He wants Elliot to burn the van and the evidence and to take care of the Whiterose . Tyrell walks off into the night.
Darlene has calmed down in the car. Dominique washes her face in the bathroom and looks over at the tub. Tyrell walks in the woods. He falls in the snow. The screeching continues. Tyrell comes across something in the ground, shining colored light on his face.

======================================================================
EPISODE: S4E05
======================================================================

Early Christmas morning, Elliot / Mr. Robot burns the crashed van that had previously surveilled him. Darlene , driving around looking for Elliot, notices the smoke coming from the burning van and investigates. As Darlene passes by, Elliot finds her and gets into her car. She assures him that "it's fine," saying "we don't have to talk." She drives through a red light, equipped with a traffic enforcement camera.
Krista descends the stairs of her home and receives texts from her boyfriend, Jason . He and Krista discuss and joke about meeting her family tonight. After a pause, Krista instead suggests that they spend Christmas alone together.
In his apartment, Elliot prepares to print a false Virtual Realty ID badge for Darlene under the name "Dolores Haze." He struggles to walk to the sink, due to the privations of the previous night, and when he washes his hands it appears he is suffering from frosting. He sits in the corner and begins to cry. As Darlene enters the room, he quickly regains his composure. The ID finishes printing.
Dominique receives a text from Janice . Dominique responds that she can't talk. Janice tells her that one of the Dark Army 's vans was discovered burnt with a body inside, and she needs Dominique to intercept the ensuing investigation. Powerless, Dominique grabs a container of Christmas cookies and proceeds to her vehicle.
Phillip sits alone in an empty restaurant, save for a family. Elliot texts him that Tyrell isn't coming, upsetting Phillip. His waiter then delivers his bill folder, wherein instructions are written for him: outside the E-Corp building, he is to give the trombone player $20.
Darlene and Elliot sit in their vehicle, parked outside Virtual Realty. Disguised as an employee, Darlene exits the vehicle and waits a bit, seeing two guards at the front desk. At 11 AM, one of them ( Dolph Lawler ) leaves, leaving only one watching Die Hard . Darlene nods to Elliot, waiting in the car. He gets out and smokes against the wall of the building, surveying Darlene. Darlene, unable to use her ID badge to get past the lobby gates, asks the guard for assistance. As she distracts the guard, Elliot quietly enters and quickly jumps over the gate. After proceeding to the basement, he hacks the door to the building's surveillance room. He then registers Darlene's alias, "Dolores Haze," as a new employee. The guard, confirming her identity as an employee, manually opens the gate for her. After she passes, the guard whistles to her, holding the phone she intentionally left behind. While Darlene is in the elevator, Elliot shuts down the building's cameras with a firmware upgrade lasting 40 minutes. With the cameras down, Darlene lifts the guard's fingerprint from her phone and picks Elliot up. Proceeding to the seventh floor, they begin to create a 3D printed mold of the guard's fingerprint. Dolph Lawler, investigating the inoperable cameras, heads to the surveillance room. He sees the firmware upgrade in progress on the computer and is unable to cancel it.
Phillip is seen outside the E Corp building, looking at the logo sculpture when his attention is drawn to the trombone player. He follows his instructions and retrieves a dry cleaner's receipt from the trombone player's hat.
Elliot finishes the creation of the 3D printed mold. Upstate at the crime scene Dominique was asked to intercept, the police take the burned body into the coroner's van. Dominique walks past an officer Deakins with a loud ring tone and leaves in her car. She is annoyed with the music on the radio. At the red light Darlene previously passed, she notices the traffic enforcement camera.
Elliot picks the lock on the emergency panel in the elevator to get him and Darlene up to the badge-restricted ninth floor. He runs into a room and puts a card in a machine.
At the local police station, Dominique is waiting. She walks into the back. Deakins hears her ringtone, but can't find her phone. She follows the sound into the back, finding her phone in an empty donut box. As she returns, it is revealed that Dominique had installed a device into the back of Deakins's computer. Back in her car, Dominique notifies Janice that they now have a remote access to the police's network. Dominique tells her to look out for red light camera reports. Dominique looks at the box of Christmas cookies she brought, upset. She receives a text from her coworker (possibly Agent Hartman ) that Deegan Maguire , the Irish mobster they arrested who specializes in making people disappear, has been released. Janice cuts open a dead dog.
At a grocery store, Krista looks through the aisles. A woman in a red jacket looks at her. As Krista goes to the cashier, the red-coated woman watches from outside.
Elliot and Darlene use the fingerprint mold to access the ninth floor server room. While Elliot deletes the "Dolores Haze" profile from the database, Darlene works to get themselves access to Virtual Realty's network. Elliot sees that they have six minutes left before the cameras go back on. After leaving the basement, Dolph notices that the elevator's emergency panel is ajar. He is suspicious and proceeds to the ninth floor. He then notices that his ID was used to enter the server room. Suspecting an intrusion, Dolph texts the other guard at the desk to call the cops. With two minutes left, Dolph enters the server room to the dismay of the Aldersons. Dolph looks through the aisles. Elliot shows Darlene that their time is up. He notices the electrical system used by the building and begins to hack it. He kills the lights and the cameras on the floor. As Dolph uses his flashlight to investigate the server room further, Elliot and Darlene finish and hurriedly exit the server room. Noticed by Dolph, Elliot zip-ties the door shut. Noticing that the elevator is coming up, the two instead run down the stairwell. The police arrive outside. The elevator descends to the main floor. Elliot and Darlene hide in the stairwell. Dolph finds them, but Elliot holds the door shut. He shares a look with Darlene before rushing past the guard, exiting the building and initiating a foot chase with the police.
Darlene goes upstairs. She hides behind a pillar from a camera. Noticing a jacket on a chair and water bottles, she formulates a plan and removes her wig. Elliot continues his foot chase, heading into Central Park. Darlene enters the lobby from the stairwell, wearing the jacket and drinking from a water bottle. She pushes the doors of the building's adjoining gym to make it seem as though she had exited from it. The authorities ignore her, enabling her to leave peacefully. Elliot, enduring a multitude of injuries as he runs through Central Park, gets on a bus with the police still in pursuit. Darlene returns to the car outside of Virtual Realty and gets Elliot's coordinates. The bus is blocked from proceeding by a patrol car. Elliot bursts out of the bus and resumes running. Frantic to get away, he is hit by an oncoming car and is rendered unable to run. Cornered on a ledge by approaching cops, Elliot hops over the road's railing and rolls down a steep embankment. He gets into the vehicle Darlene is driving, who then drives them away. Out of breath, he rests his hand on hers.
In his office, Phillip has picked up the laundry, a suit, intended to be worn at the Deus Group meeting. In one of its pockets is the location and time. He texts Elliot, confirming that the meeting will go ahead.
At her mother 's house, Dominique puts a leash on the dog as family members enjoy themselves. While walking, she notices white vans around the neighborhood. She returns to the house and writes the van's plates and locations in a book. On the news, she sees a headline describing mayhem in Central Park. She receives a text from Janice, who tells her that she needs Dominique to find the two troublemakers right away. She sends Dominique the information gathered from the red light's camera, a picture of Elliot and Darlene.
Krista is returning home with a bag of groceries. She notices the woman in the red jacket watching her from across the street. As she approaches, Krista hurriedly tries to unlock her door but drops the bag. The woman picks up a pint of ice cream for her. Krista turns and is met by Fernando Vera , who says, "It's time we talked."

======================================================================
EPISODE: S4E06

In her apartment, Fernando Vera tells Krista a story about a bully and a "little bitch." The bully picked on him every day, taking his money and beating him up. But on one Christmas Day, the little bitch received a baseball bat. Krista is tied to a chair and gagged as Vera and his two of his homies Peanuts and Javi watch. The little bitch in the story plays with his baseball bat like Sammy Sosa outside when the bully comes up to him. The little bitch hits the bully with the baseball bat, brutalizing his teeth and his eyeball. The bat's purpose was changed, and all people are in search of their purpose. Krista's purpose is to be the bat with which Vera breaks Elliot.
Elliot sits in a coffee shop on the phone with Darlene . He is going to see Olivia . Darlene is packing her clothes into a bag in Angela 's apartment. They talk about hacking Cyprus National Bank and where the Deus Group meeting is happening the next day. Darlene notices Angela's ballet shoes and pauses. Elliot apologizes for what he had said to her before about not wanting her in his life. Darlene asks if he still has the signal locator on his phone. Elliot says yeah. She tells him to be careful, as she doesn't want to lose him again. Elliot hangs up the phone as Leon enters the coffee shop.
As Darlene leaves the bedroom, Dominique is there pointing a gun at her.
Elliot asks if he brought it. Leon hands him something under the table. Elliot goes to leave, but Leon wants to chat with him. He informs Elliot that he is now a freelancer, loyal only to money. After an awkward fist bump, Leon leaves. Elliot gets in line for coffee. Mr. Robot talks with him about convincing Olivia to help with their plan, wanting to take another route. Elliot insists that this is the only way, they can't just ask her. Mr. Robot narrates about Elliot losing his code and wondering if he can bring back their boundaries.
Dominique holds Darlene at gunpoint in Angela's apartment. She asks Darlene why she was upset. Darlene asks her not to call the FBI , as the Dark Army will send someone after her. Dominique confirms that they already have. She calls Janice , who is working on a dog taxidermy. Dominique has Darlene, but is missing Elliot. Janice tells her to sit tight while she checks with her superiors.
Elliot knocks on the door to Olivia's apartment with two coffees. She invites him in, taking the coffee cup and drinking from it. Elliot says that what he is about to say is going to sound crazy. He explains that her clients at Cyprus National Bank funnel money for the Deus Group. The Deus Group runs the world and are responsible for the international warfare and the cyber bombings, among other atrocities. Olivia is scared. Elliot explains that he hacked her and needs Olivia to call her boss to log in so Elliot can steal his credentials. Elliot tells her that the Deus Group are using her and that he can stop them. Olivia tells him to get out. He walks to the door, but warns her about failing her drug test. He knows about her custody battle for her son. She is eight years clean. But he drugged her coffee. Olivia, upset, asks him on why he's doing this to her. He tells her he's running out of time.
In a darkened meeting room, Zhang stands before a whiteboard covered in math equations and scientific writings. Wang Shu approaches and shows him the red light camera's picture of Elliot and Darlene taken near the burnt van. They have Darlene in custody, she reports. Wang urges that it is time to get rid of Elliot. Zhang refuses. He wants to bring in Elliot to the meeting and show him that they are on the same side.
Dominique holds the gun at Darlene sitting across the table. Janice calls. Dominique says that everything is fine. Janice says that the higher-ups want Elliot. Dominique says that they can use Darlene's phone to find him. Janice tells her to kill Darlene, reminding her to keep it 100% and finish the job or else her family dies. Janice and her goons are coming to retrieve the phone. Dominique is stunned. Darlene asks her what happened. Dominique forcefully pushes Darlene into the bathtub and puts the gun to her head. Darlene begs for her life. Dominique says that she ruined her life. Darlene apologizes and pleads that she can get Dominique out, as they are taking down the Dark Army tonight. Dominique emphasizes that when Janice arrives and if Darlene isn't dead, her family will die. As Darlene pleads, Dominique struggles with her conscience and pistol whips Darlene unconscious.
Olivia is making the call. She can't get through to her boss but is assured he will call back. Hanging up, Olivia expresses her hatred for Elliot. He assures her nothing will be traced back to her. She is concerned about relapsing from the drugged coffee. It will destroy her. Elliot blames her for working for Cyprus National Bank. She knew an offshore bank was engaging in criminal activity, but she needed the money. That's what they will do, he explains, back people into a corner and get them to compromise themselves. This is why he needs to take them down. Olivia asks him how many people he has hurt. She asks to go to the bathroom and asks if having sex was part of his plan. He says it wasn't. Elliot tells Mr. Robot that they're almost done here, again blaming her for being in denial about Cyprus National Bank. Mr. Robot narrates about the overwhelming sense of dread. They hear a thud in the bathroom. Elliot finds that Olivia has slit her wrists with a razor.
Krista is telling Vera that Elliot has insomnia. He's not buying her generic answers, he wants the real dirt. Krista says that she knows nothing. Vera insists that she and Elliot had a special relationship. Krista says he hacked her and threatened her then-boyfriend Michael Hensen , that he scares her. Vera insists that he saw the look on her face, she loves him. Krista says that Vera was bullied as a kid and learned to hurt people back, but his outbursts won't work on her. Vera confirms with his homies Peanuts and Javi that Krista is calling him a little bitch. He finds it amusing. There's a knock on the door. Peanuts puts back her mouth gag and discerns from her that it is her boyfriend Jason . Vera considers bringing him in to make her talk.
Elliot has taped Olivia's wrists and stopped the bleeding. He tells her that she's going to be okay and says that he's sorry. He puts the phone in her hand, showing a bunch of missed calls from her boss. She asks about one of the atrocities he attributed to the Deus Group, a paramilitary massacre in Colombia. He confirms that it was the Deus Group who killed her mom. Elliot tells her that he can stop them. Olivia calls her boss and asks about a money transfer. Elliot uses his phone to hack Cyprus National Bank and steals the password. Olivia hangs up. Elliot says that he'll wipe any involvement of her and her boss. Olivia tells him that though she works for monsters, he is the worst kind of monster: The kind who doesn't even know it. Elliot walks away. Mr. Robot watches her. Olivia then starts to cry.
Jason is waiting outside Krista's apartment. Vera watches, amused, from the window. Jason leaves. Vera returns to the little bitch conversation, expanding on his story. The bully wakes up in the hospital. The little bitch walks in and the bully starts crying, afraid. The little bitch holds his hand tenderly, which Vera does to Krista. This is how you own someone, he explains: "Breaking them, and building them back up." Vera wants to own Elliot, as they are linked on a spiritual plane. He knows Jason's address. Krista knows what he wants, Vera insists, and he can let her go once she tells him. He wants eye contact and her trust. Krista reveals where Elliot's folder is. Inside is the information about Mr. Robot: how to break Elliot.
It's 3:25 PM. Dominique waits as Darlene wakes up with a bloody head. Dominique wants her to unlock the phone. Darlene won't do it, asking what if it was her family. Dominique confirms that this is all to protect her family. Darlene brings up the night they spent together, but Dominique doesn't want to hear it. Darlene says that it was nice, the last time she felt good. Dominique declares that she's out of time. She takes Darlene into the hallway and puts the gun into her hands, pointing it at her chest. Dominique insists that she will kill her and escape. Killing herself will save her family, and though she's thought about it every day for these past two months, she can't do it herself. Darlene refuses. Janice and her goons enter Angela's apartment. She is stunned. She won't kill Dominique, but will make things very painful for her. Janice wants the phone from Darlene, but Darlene has wiped it.
Elliot and Mr. Robot are leaving the subway, rising to the street. Mr. Robot wants to talk about Olivia, but Elliot is focused on the plan to rob Cyprus National Bank. Krista calls, telling Elliot about Vera kidnapping her. She went to the police, but doesn't feel safe going home. They arrange to meet. Mr. Robot tells Elliot that there's no way Vera let her go. As Elliot walks off, Mr. Robot narrates about Elliot playing hero after he destroyed someone's life. He wonders if the pressure changes people or reveals who they really were. Vera's homies, Peanuts and Javi suddenly grab Elliot, throw him into the trunk of their car, and drive off.

EPISODE: S4E07
======================================================================

Elliot is still in the trunk of the car. When it comes to a stop, Fernando Vera 's homies Peanuts and Javi pull Elliot out of the trunk.
In Krista's apartment, Fernando Vera lights up his weed and smokes. Elliot is tied and gagged in the chair. Vera apologizes for fanboying as he gets emotional. He says that he did Elliot, his hero, wrong for the last time, but that was a turning point in their story. He has Javi remove the gag. Mr. Robot analyzes the building and the captors. Elliot is not thinking about an escape route; he wants to help Krista . Elliot asks why Vera didn't meet him in October, to which Vera tells him that he had to be prepared.
While Krista is tied up in the therapy room, Vera tells Elliot about his return to the Dominican Republic after escaping from prison. The people didn't think much of him, but he hustled his way up the crime ladder. In just 87 days, Vera controlled the entire island of Hispaniola from the shadows, with even the president of the Dominican Republic in his back pocket. Despite all of this, he still wasn't satisfied, so Javi brought a shaman to him. Vera drank a concoction, making him puke and defecate repeatedly. The shaman told him to go home. Vera realized that New York is where he's meant to be. The shaman told him to reconcile with he who closed that path, and he will be his partner. Vera wants to own all of New York City with Elliot by his side. Elliot asks about Krista. Vera eats ham with his brother Isaac 's knife, which likely killed Shayla . They realize that this is the same situation as the Shayla situation, but this time Vera allows Elliot to see the hostage.
In the therapy room, Elliot meets with Krista. The homies grab Elliot, and Vera demands an introduction with Mr. Robot. Elliot plays dumb. Vera asks him how to bring out Mr. Robot. He touches Krista's legs and goes up her skirt and suggests that Javi will rape her. Mr. Robot says let's talk. He goes face to face with Vera, asking what he wants. Peanuts aims her gun at the brash Mr. Robot, but Vera tells her off. Vera asks why Mr. Robot is here. Mr. Robot says that he's here to protect Elliot. Vera asks him how he came to be. Mr. Robot reiterates that Elliot needed him. Vera surmises that Elliot was hurt really bad. He doesn't care about his dad dying when he was eight and his abusive mother , he wants details. Mr. Robot tells Vera that his credentials are poor and that he needs to convince Mr. Robot. He's the one who did 5/9 . Vera explains that he wants to own everything in NY, pushing his product out of every store, cop, and billboard. Mr. Robot responds that the pharmaceutical companies own drug dealing, banks own the stores. Power is just money and capitalist pigs. But Mr. Robot has a plan. Step one is to let Krista go. Vera says Krista is the only thing he has to bargain. How can he trust him? Elliot says that he can show him. The hack is going down tonight. More money than Vera can conceive of. The plan is on his laptop. Vera sends Javi for the bag. Vera tells Elliot that while Mr. Robot barks a lot, he's more scared of Elliot.
At the kitchen table, Elliot reaches into his bag for his laptop, seeing a gun. He shows Vera the info. Vera laughs at the huge amount of money shown as Peanuts looks too. Elliot looks at the gun. Javi joins in to look at the laptop when Elliot pulls the gun on them. Vera says that he won't do it. Elliot pulls the trigger, but it's empty. Javi took the bullets. Mr. Robot takes the blame for the stunt, but Vera wants punishment. He loads the gun and retrieves Krista. Elliot pleads for her life while Vera prods him. Elliot admits that he needs her. The storm outside is fully brewing. Vera realizes that she is Elliot's shaman. It isn't Mr. Robot who has the answers. And the wrong person has been asking the questions.
Vera unties Krista in the therapy room and sits Elliot down. He wants a session to explore Elliot's mind. He tells them to pick up where they left off, but Krista insists that this won't work. Elliot tells her to go along with it. Vera dismisses his homies so they can be alone. Vera shoots the floor near Krista, scaring her. Elliot helps her, bringing up that his mom died. (“ 402 Payment Required ”) She asks about his feelings. Vera is impatient hearing about their strained relationship. He wants to know why Mr. Robot exists. Mr. Robot says that she sold them out. Krista apologizes to Elliot. Mr. Robot is thinking of an exit strategy. Vera reads aloud from Krista's folder on Elliot. Krista pleads with him to stop. Mr. Robot tells Elliot not to listen. Elliot notices that Krista doesn't want him to hear this, and neither does Mr. Robot. Regardless, Elliot wants Vera to keep reading. Vera reads that the strained Elliot-Mr. Robot relationship is keeping them from getting at the root of the condition. He asks about the window incident. Krista is silent. Mr. Robot wants to shut it down. Elliot recalls that he jumped out of the window. Krista begins to ask him why he can't recall details of that memory. She helps him to remember: building the snowman with Darlene , looking for their dad's camera upstairs. Elliot hid Darlene in the closet, grabbed a bat, started swinging at his dad, and jumped. Krista notes that his lost time memory gaps happen when Mr. Robot takes over.
Elliot asks Mr. Robot if he existed way back then. Mr. Robot changes the subject, but Elliot yells at him to answer. Mr. Robot says that he's been there since the first day he was needed. His job is to protect him. Krista doesn't want to do this to Elliot. He's not supposed to know, Mr. Robot says. Vera is hyped. Krista asks why Elliot did what he did. Why he had the reaction to swing the bat and protect himself. Elliot can't remember. Krista helps him realize that he was scared. Mr. Robot claims this will destroy him. Vera adds that Elliot was scared of his father. Elliot believes that his father was his friend. Mr. Robot says that he can't protect him anymore and walks away from the scene. Krista asks if his father ever hurt him. She repeats the events moment by moment. Elliot escaped out the window as his only way out of this. Elliot grows more emotional. Krista eventually asks if his father sexually molested him. Elliot weeps and confirms.
Krista gives her condolences. Vera sits beside Elliot, saying he knows pain and Elliot doesn't have to be scared. Elliot doesn't want to be touched. He leaves the room. Vera follows him into the kitchen. He tells Elliot that he can't stop this. Elliot doesn't want to live with it. Vera insists this is how he is to reach his true self, let out his anger and sadness. Elliot screams at the thunder and lightning outside the window. Vera concludes that Elliot is reborn. He puts his hands on his shoulders. Elliot blames Vera for doing this. They sit together. Vera says that his own mother passed him around to her friends. That kind of trauma takes a lot. Most people don't know that pain, but survivors become unbeatable. Vera then starts crying. He tells Elliot that his power is beautiful. Elliot says that he doesn't want to be alone anymore. Vera tells him that he isn't. There is a thud and Vera's eyes go wide and he then starts wheezing. Krista has stabbed Vera in the back with the same knife that was used to kill Shayla. Vera collapses. All the lights go out.

EPISODE: S4E08
======================================================================

At the Queens Museum in 1995, a Young Elliot runs through the empty halls as Angela counts for hide and seek. Elliot goes through a staff-only door and finds a storage room. He talks to someone who isn't there, saying that he trusts him and that Angela won't find something. He goes on to hide something in a crevice in the wall. Elliot returns to the visitor's area, where Angela spots him in the giant map room and playfully chases him.
In Krista's apartment, Fernando Vera lies dead. Krista is freaking out, hearing Vera's phone ring and checking outside to see Peanuts calling, with Javi nearby. Elliot is staring at a younger version of himself standing before him. Krista breaks his trance and insists that they leave. Outside, Peanuts convinces Javi to go back inside. They find Vera's body, see that Krista and Elliot have escaped, and take his wallet.
In the street, Krista hails a cab. She tells the driver to take them to the nearest police station. On the cab's TV, Tyrell Wellick delivers E Corp 's holiday greeting. At the DiPierro house, the kids are playing cards when Dominique's mom, Trudy DiPierro , has to play mediator. One of the boys, Tommy , curses at her and is sent to timeout in the living room. He sees masked men storming the front door. They rush in and tie up everyone in the house.
Janice is in Angela's apartment, looking out the window. She tells the story about the accidental creation of cement by lightning to a tied up Dominique and Darlene . One of her soldiers says that Darlene's phone is completely wiped. Janice tells Darlene to restore it. Darlene is defiant. Dominique insists that Darlene doesn't know where Elliot is and wouldn't give him up. Janice can't trust Dominique, as she failed her. Janice notes that Dominique cares about Darlene, given her masturbating to her interrogation video. (“ 404 Not Found ”) Janice senses the awkward tension and realizes Darlene hadn't known. She takes out her bag of tools. Darlene dismisses her relationship with Dominique was just about sex. Janice presses her, but Darlene just wants to get things over with. Janice stabs Dominique in the chest, puncturing a lung and sending her falling to the floor. Dominique has about 15 minutes for Darlene to give up Elliot's location.
Krista and Elliot get off at the police station, but Elliot won't go inside. He asks her what people do when they find out what he just found out. Krista counsels him through his doubts and fear, telling him that he can survive. Elliot tells her that she doesn't have to take care of him anymore. Krista wants to see him again. Elliot sees the young boy across the street. He hugs Krista. She enters the police station. Elliot follows the boy into the subway and asks where they're going.
Dominique lies there, dying on the floor. Janice praises Dominique's gumption and acknowledges that moles have growing pains. Dominique tells Darlene not to say anything. Janice recognizes their special relationship and talks about Dominique's mom, Trudy. She talks about her own interest in taxidermy in high school and all the tests she took saying she was normal. Janice decides to take things up a notch and calls her team at the DiPierro house to start killing the family. Dominique begs her to stop. Darlene intervenes, agreeing to fix the phone.
At the Queens Museum, Elliot sees the boy inside. He finds him in the map room. Elliot asks him why he brought him here. He thinks it's because this is where he ran away from his father, Edward . Elliot apologizes for not protecting his younger self, screaming it aloud. The boy says that isn't why and leads Elliot into the storage room. They uncover the hiding spot in the wall. Elliot finds a small bag holding a key. The key to his childhood bedroom. Their dad's key, the boy clarifies. Elliot hid it to keep the monster out. He wasn't running away. He was fighting back.
Outside Krista's apartment, medics load Vera's body bag into an ambulance. A Dark Army Op relays to Janice over the phone that they tracked Elliot's phone there, but the body isn't his. Janice is mad at Darlene. She gets her phone to order the death of Trudy. There is no answer. Janice tries again. Dominique tells Janice to check her phone, as "he," Deegan Maguire , has probably been trying to call her. Janice sees the missed calls from the "Lucky Irish bastard" and calls him. He explains that Dominique's plan worked. He killed all the Dark Army men and is taking the family to a safe house. As Janice threatens him over the phone. Dominique pulls the knife out of her chest, cuts one of the goon's ankles, gets his gun, and shoots the three captors in the head. Darlene frees herself and Dominique. Dominique calls in for an officer down. She tells Darlene to go. Darlene blames herself and wants to stay, but Dominique tells her to help Elliot take down the Dark Army. Darlene leaves.
Elliot is coding at the abandoned Allsafe . Mr. Robot enters the scene. Elliot tells him that he is sorry for the timeout, but the hack is almost ready to go and the Deus Group meeting is in an hour. Mr. Robot asks him why he has been let back in. He explains that his reason for existence was to protect Elliot, as his father couldn't. Mr. Robot kept the happy memories, hiding the truth to protect himself as much as Elliot, afraid of how it might hurt him. Mr. Robot apologizes for keeping Elliot in the dark. And if he must be gone for good, Mr. Robot wants him to know that he is not, nor ever was, Elliot's father. Elliot knows, that he created him to be the father he needed, not the one he had. Mr. Robot starts to say that if he could go back in time and stop all of this from happening. . . . But Elliot counters that he wouldn't be who he is today, and he wouldn't have Mr. Robot. As Mr. Robot puts his hands on Elliot's shoulders, Elliot says that he can't do the hack. He can't do anything. Elliot begins weeping.

EPISODE: S4E09
======================================================================

A door below an exit sign opens and Mr. Robot comes through. He walks down a long hallway and through an identical door. He enters a meeting room where a young version of Elliot's mother, Magda Alderson , and a younger version of Elliot sit at the round table. Magda asks him, "How is he?" Mr. Robot says that it isn't going to happen today so there's no point in waiting; They need to help him through this. Magda wants to bring him here. Young Elliot asks him if they should tell him everything. Mr. Robot declines again. Magda says Mr. Robot has let this go on for too long. Mr. Robot says they just have to finish Elliot's hack, and then they can get through. Magda asks how. Mr. Robot replies, "Show him what he did." Magda says they can't go on like this if it doesn't work and that they may lose the poor boy forever. Mr. Robot says he woke up when Darlene talked to him two months ago. She is the key.
Darlene is in a hotel room, prepping for the hack on a laptop. Mr. Robot enters, narrating that he is here while Elliot is dealing with his mental trauma. Mr. Robot notes that the Deus Group should be arriving soon. Darlene asks where's he's been, but Mr. Robot simply says that he was held up. Darlene asserts she had a bad day too. As they bicker, Darlene realizes that's she's with Mr. Robot and asks what happened. Mr. Robot says that Elliot will tell her when he's ready. There is a knock at the door. Phillip enters. Mr. Robot says this is risky, as the Deus Group meeting is right across the street. Phillip says that he needs a favor and hands over a thumb drive. He asks Mr. Robot to promise to destroy the Whiterose 's machine, as Angela wanted. Mr. Robot agrees. He tells Phillip to keep everyone at the meeting while they hack their phones. Phillip leaves. Darlene is surprised that Phillip knows Angela. Later, Phillip is narrating the plan to steal the numbers and the bank accounts. Phillip approaches the Deus Group meeting. Inside, in an open space museum floor, Phillip finds Zhang sitting at a table for two.
Darlene sits at her laptop, wondering aloud why Angela never told her that Phillip was her father. Mr. Robot says that maybe she didn't know. Darlene states that she misses Angela. Mr. Robot is watching the Deus Group guards from the window. He finds it suspicious that no one has entered or left except Phillip. Darlene wonders if their plan has been discovered. Phillip is patted down by the masked Dark Army soldiers. Zhang wants to have a drink. Phillip wants to skip the foreplay.
Mr. Robot says they have been found out. If the Deus Group doesn't show up, it's over. He concludes that Elliot would look for abnormalities. He goes on the laptop and recalls that Elliot saved an image on Tyrell 's phone. Zhang decries that Phillip couldn't wait until the new year and that he would have been allowed to live in retirement. Darlene takes the laptop and starts looking at Tyrell's calendar. Zhang asks what Phillip and Elliot were working on and if Phillip reveals it, he will be allowed to go home and die in his sleep. Otherwise, they have their methods. Darlene finds the image, a different location for the Deus Group meeting. Mr. Robot muses that if Phillip is the only one who got the other address, the guards aren't there to just kill him, they're there to protect someone else. Zhang gloats that the meeting is taking place as they speak and Tyrell is impressing everyone. Phillip says that he expects a mutiny because Tyrell isn't there. Darlene wants to go to the new location. Mr. Robot wants to stay and keep an eye on the Whiterose. Darlene doesn't want to know if the plan goes wrong, and they only have one device to catch the numbers. Mr. Robot sends her off.
Wang Shu confirms that Tyrell is not at the meeting. Zhang is angry, asking where Tyrell is. Phillip doesn't know, continuing to drink. Wang wants to go to the meeting, as Phillip is nothing but a fool. Zhang refuses. Wang insists that letting Elliot live has led them to this delay. She tells Zhang that Elliot has beat him and they must warn the Deus Group. When Zhang refuses again, Wang quits and walks out.
Darlene is at the new location, a restaurant called Cipriani. Inside, the room is filled with Deus Group members. The kitchen staff is busy. A worker goes outside for a cigarette, but a guard tells her to go back inside, that the area is secured. Darlene watches from the barricades at the corner. She is distraught at the level of security, but notices a nearby building being used to film "Shift + Control," a TV show inspired by fsociety .
Mr. Robot grabs his phone. He calls Phillip's phone and Zhang picks up. They exchange a few words, then Zhang offers to reveal something about Angela if he stops his plot. Zhang says Angela is not dead. Mr. Robot reminds him he saw the picture of her corpse. Zhang insists that she is alive and not to believe everything he sees. Zhang can take Elliot to see her, hear her voice, hold her hand. Suddenly, it is Elliot holding the phone. Zhang offers to show Elliot a world without his pain or regrets. Elliot sheds a tear, saying he saw what Angela became because of the Whiterose's using her. Zhang says to ask her yourself. Elliot receives a message from Darlene to turn on the TV.
The news shows a new fsociety video. Darlene has donned the mask and reveals to the camera that the Deus Group runs the world. She has doxxed them, linking their private files, and inviting people to the meeting location. Zhang is furious. Elliot gets a call from Darlene. The fsociety video will smoke them out, Darlene says. Elliot tells her that he had spoken to the Whiterose. Darlene asks if he's okay and is glad that he's back. Elliot notices a cell tower nearby and enacts a plan to get the numbers. Zhang is on the phone, calming down the Deus Group members, telling them not to go outside. They hang up. Zhang yells at Phillip. Elliot is hacking while Darlene hacks the restaurant's garage barricade. At the meeting, one member starts to leave, starting a rush for the exit. Their cars are trapped in the garage because of a jammer Darlene has left behind. The Deus Group members spill into the back alley. Darlene watches from the barricade as a crowd swarms. Darlene hacks on her phone. She is capturing people's numbers while Elliot phishes for access to the cell tower. He is successful. The garage barricade is opened manually. Zhang is pacing, wondering if the front entrance is secure and demanding the car be brought. Phillip marvels at what havoc a pipsqueak in a hoodie has wrought. Elliot is hacking. Mr. Robot asks for an update. They have a bunch of people's numbers, but don't know if the Whiterose is among them. Darlene has captured 99 of 100 Deus Group accounts. She checks with Elliot. Phillip rubs it in Zhang's face that Elliot is the only one who could truly hurt him.
Zhang and Phillip exit the museum. Phillip stops on the stairs to take in the cold, peaceful night. Zhang asks if Phillip must be forced into the car. Phillip admits that he almost believed that Angela was still alive. But he knows Zhang is a con man. Darlene finds the final account. She tells Elliot to start the bank transfer. Cars begin picking up the Deus Group members. One of the men receives a text from the bank with a 2FA code. Elliot intercepts it. Phillip tells Zhang that Angela lives on in the people who love her and have set off to destroy Zhang. The money transfer is complete. Elliot marvels with Mr. Robot. Zhang receives the message on his phone as Phillip concludes that they are broke. Zhang yells as the accounts are overdrawn. Phillip tells Zhang that his project, his dream of another world, is all but dead. Zhang grabs a gun from a Dark Army soldier and shoots Phillip multiple times. Elliot and Mr. Robot arrive on the sidewalk across the street to see Phillip fall dead. Mr. Robot narrates that Rome has fallen: no more top 1% playing gods. As one Deus Group member is driven away, his picture is being taken by the crowd. He sees Darlene in the crowd. Elliot puts on his hoodie and walks away as Zhang looks in his direction before being driven away.
In her residence, the Whiterose applies lipstick as the police bang on the front door. They demand that Zhang open up, count down, and bust down the doors, and they and the guards start exchanging gunfire.

A news anchor (Gretchen Carlson) explains that of the data dump from fsociety doxxing the Deus Group , a few documents have been substantiated but intelligence agencies caution about believing them as a whole. Dominique lies in a hospital bed watching the news as an FBI Agent tells her that she is under investigation for serious crimes. Dominique sees the news covering Minister Zhang being exposed as the Whiterose , head of the Dark Army . She recalls when Zhang showed her a closet full of dresses in China. (“ eps2.3_logic_b0mb.hc ”) Dominique tells the nurse, Sharon Watt, that she doesn't want any drugs, as she wants to leave. Sharon and the agent tell her that she can't. Her family is in a safe house, the agent assures her. Dominique sheds a tear musing that they don't trust her. The agent tells her to get some sleep and leaves. The news covers that fsociety is believed to be the architect of the heist. Dominique insists to Sharon that since the doctor said the surgery went great and she can walk without tearing her stitches, the hospital can't keep her against her wishes. Dominique is being discharged in a wheelchair. Outside, the orderly, Travis Rehwaldt , tells her she needs to get a ride from someone she knows, but Dominique has no one. Travis tells her to stay put while he calls social services.
Dominique enters her apartment. She shoves a dresser in front of the door and makes a grilled cheese sandwich. Darlene knocks to enter. She is alarmed, saying that Dominique can't stay there. Dominique says the hospital wasn't safe, given the news. Darlene tells her she and Elliot have a getaway plan. Dominique doesn't want to go, insisting on her name being cleared, seeing her family, and apologizing to them. Dominique plays music on her Amazon Alexa and eats the sandwich.

She has fake passports and plane tickets. Dominique says that she has Alexa, but Darlene smashes it on the floor, telling her that Alexa is just a robot and the apartment is emptiness.
Elliot is in a motel room, reading files on the Washington Township project. He goes outside to smoke. Darlene and Dominique arrive by taxi. Darlene tells Dominique to go to the room without her while she meets with Elliot. She senses that Elliot isn't coming with them. He is going back to the Washington Township plant without her. She's fine with it, claiming to be done with it all. Before she goes, she offers her phone to do the honors. The money is now untraceable. Elliot tells her that it's her win to take.
